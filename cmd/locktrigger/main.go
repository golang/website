// Locktrigger “locks” a given build trigger, making sure that
// the currently running build is the only trigger running.
//
// Usage:
//
//	locktrigger -project=$PROJECT_ID -build=$BUILD_ID
//
// The $PROJECT_ID and $BUILD_ID are typically written literally in cloudbuild.yaml
// and then substituted by Cloud Build.
//
// When a project uses “continuous deployment powered by Cloud Build”,
// the deployment is a little bit too continuous: when multiple commits
// land in a short time window, Cloud Build will run all the triggered
// build jobs in parallel. If each job does “gcloud app deploy”, there
// is no guarantee which will win: perhaps an older commit will complete
// last, resulting in the newest commit not actually being the final
// deployed version of the site. This should probably be fixed in
// “continuous deployment powered by Cloud Build”, but until then,
// locktrigger works around the problem.
//
// All triggered builds must run locktrigger to guarantee mutual exclusion.
// When there is contention—that is, when multiple builds are running and
// they all run locktrigger—the build corresponding to the newest commit
// is permitted to continue running, and older builds are canceled.
//
// When locktrigger exits successfully, then, at that moment, the current
// build is (or recently was) the only running build for its trigger.
// Of course, another build may start immediately after locktrigger exits.
// As long as that build also runs locktrigger, then either it will cancel
// itself (if it is older than we are), or it will cancel us before proceeding
// (if we are older than it is).
