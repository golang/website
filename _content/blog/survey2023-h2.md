summary: Help shape the future of Go by sharing your thoughts via the Go Developer Survey
---

It's that time again! Today we launch the latest iteration of the [Go
Developer
Survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4Vi4bNaMQhQdqSi?s=b). Over
the past seven years, the Go team has conducted regular surveys of Go
developers and used the results to prioritize language, runtime, and tooling
improvements. We want Go to be increasingly usable by and useful to
developers, and your feedback has been a critical part of making this happen.

This survey will help the Go team understand your overall experience working
with Go, the tech stacks developers commonly use alongside Go, interest in
AI/ML developer tooling, challenges when building microservices, and more. The
survey will run through August 10th and we plan to publish anonymous,
aggregated results in September. It should take about 10 minutes to complete
and all questions are optional. Please help shape Go's future by sharing your
thoughts and experiences.
