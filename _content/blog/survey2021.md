## Help shape the future of Go {#help}

Today we are launching the 2021 Go Developer Survey.
We'd love to hear from everyone who uses Go,
used to use Go, or is interested in using Go,
to help ensure the language, community, and ecosystem fit the needs of the
people closest to it.
Please help us shape Go's future by participating in this 10-minute survey by November 16th:
[Take the 2021 Go Developer Survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0BwHwKSaeE9Cx2S).

Since 2016, thousands of Gophers around the world have helped the Go project
by sharing their thoughts via our annual Go Developer Survey.
Your feedback has played an enormous role in driving changes to our language,
ecosystem, and community, including the gopls language server,
the latest generics proposal, the module mirror, and so much more.
And of course, we publicly share [each year's results](/blog/survey2020-results),
so we can all benefit from the community's insights.

This year we’re rotating in some new questions. The specific questions each person will see are randomly selected, so you won’t see every question we ask. This approach allows us to ask about a wide variety of topics while also reducing the survey’s length.

## Spread the word!

We need as many Gophers as possible to participate in this survey to help
us better understand our global user base.
We'd be grateful if you would spread the word by sharing this post on your
social network feeds,
around the office, at virtual meet-ups, and in other communities. Thank you!
