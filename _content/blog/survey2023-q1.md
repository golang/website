summary: Help shape the future of Go by sharing your thoughts via the Go Developer Survey
---

Happy 2023! For seven years, the Go Team has conducted a regular survey of Go
developers. The results of this survey have helped the team plan and prioritize
large changes to the Go ecosystem, such as dependency management, vulnerability
scanning, and generics. We want Go to be increasingly usable by and useful to
developers, and your feedback has been a critical aspect of making that happen. 

So here is [the January 2023 edition of the Go Developer
Survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bNnbAtFZ0vfRTH8?s=b)! This
survey will run through Feb 8th, and we plan to publish anonymous, aggregated
results in early March. It should take about  10 minutes to complete, and all
questions are optional. Please help to shape Goâ€™s future by sharing your
thoughts and experiences.

Survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bNnbAtFZ0vfRTH8?s=b) (open
