summary: Please take a Gopher Survey. We want to hear from you!
---


Over the past couple of years Go has attracted a lot of users and contributors,
and I've had a great time meeting and talking with many of you.
However, for every Gopher I know there are dozens I know nothing about.
In order to address this imbalance I've prepared a survey for Go users everywhere.

The survey is short. It asks about you, your involvement with Go,
and your interest in Go-related events.
Among other things, this data will help myself and the rest of the Go team
plan future Go events and schedule conference appearances.

Please take a minute to [complete the survey now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dFdxOTU1Mm92VFA3eHdkekFPamJjUnc6MQ#gid=0).

Thanks!

Andrew
