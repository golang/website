We will be releasing Go 1.18 soon, and this release includes a few new concepts
for Go. We have published two new tutorials to help introduce you to these
upcoming features.

The first new [tutorial will help you get started with
generics](/doc/tutorial/generics). This tutorial walks you through
creating a generic function that can handle multiple types, and calling it from
your code. Once you’ve created a generic function, you’ll learn about type
constraints, and write some for your function. Also consider checking out the
[GopherCon talk about
generics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35eIxI_n5ZM&t=1755s) to learn more.

The second new [tutorial will help you get started with
fuzzing](/doc/tutorial/fuzz). This tutorial demonstrates how
fuzzing can find bugs in your code, and walks through the process of diagnosing
and fixing the issues. In this tutorial, you will write code that has a few bugs
and use fuzzing to find, fix, and verify the bugs using the go command. Special
thanks to Beth Brown for her work on the fuzzing tutorial!

Go 1.18 Beta 1 was released last month, which you can get by visiting the
[downloads page](/dl/#go1.18beta1).

See the full [draft release notes for Go
1.18](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18) for more details about what to expect
in the release.

As always, if you notice any problems, please [file an
issue](/issue/new).

We hope you enjoy the tutorials, and we look forward to everything to come in
2022!
