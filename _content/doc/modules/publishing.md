<!--{
  "Title": "Publishing a module"
}-->

When you want to make a module available for other developers, you publish it so
that it's visible to Go tools. Once you've published the module, developers
importing its packages will be able to resolve a dependency on the module by
running commands such as `go get`.

> **Note:** Don't change a tagged version of a module after publishing it. For
developers using the module, Go tools authenticate a downloaded module against
the first downloaded copy. If the two differ, Go tools will return a security
error. Instead of changing the code for a previously published version, publish
a new version.

## Publishing steps

Use the following steps to publish a module.

1. Open a command prompt and change to your module's root directory in the local
  repository.

1.  Run `go mod tidy`, which removes any dependencies the module might have
  accumulated that are no longer necessary.

    ```
    $ go mod tidy
    ```

1.  Run `go test ./...` a final time to make sure everything is working.

    This runs the unit tests you've written to use the Go testing framework.

    ```
    $ go test ./...
    ok      example.com/mymodule       0.015s
    ```

1.  Tag the project with a new version number using the `git tag` command.

    For the version number, use a number that signals to users the nature of
    changes in this release. For more, see [Module version
    numbering](version-numbers).

    ```
    $ git commit -m "mymodule: changes for v0.1.0"
    $ git tag v0.1.0
    ```

1.  Push the new tag to the origin repository.

    ```
    $ git push origin v0.1.0
    ```

1.  Make the module available by running the [`go list`
  command](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-List_packages_or_modules) to prompt
  Go to update its index of modules with information about the module you're
  publishing.

    Precede the command with a statement to set the `GOPROXY` environment
    variable to a Go proxy. This will ensure that your request reaches the
    proxy.

    ```
    $ GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org go list -m example.com/mymodule@v0.1.0
    ```

Developers interested in your module import a package from it and run the [`go
get` command]() just as they would with any other module. They can run the [`go
get` command]() for latest versions or they can specify a particular version, as
in the following example:

```
$ go get example.com/mymodule@v0.1.0
```
