## Introduction {#introduction}

Modules are how Go manages dependencies.

This document is a detailed reference manual for Go's module system. For an
introduction to creating Go projects, see [How to Write Go
Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html). For information on using modules,
migrating projects to modules, and other topics, see the blog series starting
with [Using Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules).

## Modules, packages, and versions {#modules-overview}

A <dfn>module</dfn> is a collection of packages that are released, versioned,
and distributed together. Modules may be downloaded directly from version
control repositories or from module proxy servers.

A module is identified by a [module path](#glos-module-path), which is declared
in a [`go.mod` file](#go-mod-file), together with information about the
module's dependencies. The <dfn>module root directory</dfn> is the directory
that contains the `go.mod` file. The <dfn>main module</dfn> is the module
containing the directory where the `go` command is invoked.

Each <dfn>package</dfn> within a module is a collection of source files in the
same directory that are compiled together. A <dfn>package path</dfn> is the
module path joined with the subdirectory containing the package (relative to the
module root). For example, the module `"golang.org/x/net"` contains a package in
the directory `"html"`. That package's path is `"golang.org/x/net/html"`.

### Module paths {#module-path}

A <dfn>module path</dfn> is the canonical name for a module, declared with the
[`module` directive](#go-mod-file-module) in the module's [`go.mod`
file](#glos-go-mod-file). A module's path is the prefix for package paths within
the module.

A module path should describe both what the module does and where to find it.
Typically, a module path consists of a repository root path, a directory within
the repository (usually empty), and a major version suffix (only for major
version 2 or higher).

* The <dfn>repository root path</dfn> is the portion of the module path that
  corresponds to the root directory of the version control repository where the
  module is developed. Most modules are defined in their repository's root
  directory, so this is usually the entire path. For example,
  `golang.org/x/net` is the repository root path for the module of the same
  name. See [Finding a repository for a module path](#vcs-find) for information
  on how the `go` command locates a repository using HTTP requests derived
  from a module path.
* If the module is not defined in the repository's root directory, the
  <dfn>module subdirectory</dfn> is the part of the module path that names the
  directory, not including the major version suffix. This also serves as a
  prefix for semantic version tags. For example, the module
  `golang.org/x/tools/gopls` is in the `gopls` subdirectory of the repository
  with root path `golang.org/x/tools`, so it has the module subdirectory
  `gopls`. See [Mapping versions to commits](#vcs-version) and [Module
  directories within a repository](#vcs-dir).
* If the module is released at major version 2 or higher, the module path must
  end with a [major version suffix](#major-version-suffixes) like
  `/v2`. This may or may not be part of the subdirectory name. For example, the
  module with path `golang.org/x/repo/sub/v2` could be in the `/sub` or
  `/sub/v2` subdirectory of the repository `golang.org/x/repo`.

If a module might be depended on by other modules, these rules must be followed
so that the `go` command can find and download the module. There are also
several [lexical restrictions](#go-mod-file-ident) on characters allowed in
module paths.

### Versions {#versions}

A <dfn>version</dfn> identifies an immutable snapshot of a module, which may be
either a [release](#glos-release-version) or a
[pre-release](#glos-pre-release-version). Each version starts with the letter
`v`, followed by a semantic version. See [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for details on how versions are
formatted, interpreted, and compared.

To summarize, a semantic version consists of three non-negative integers (the
major, minor, and patch versions, from left to right) separated by dots. The
patch version may be followed by an optional pre-release string starting with a
hyphen. The pre-release string or patch version may be followed by a build
metadata string starting with a plus. For example, `v0.0.0`, `v1.12.134`,
`v8.0.5-pre`, and `v2.0.9+meta` are valid versions.

Each part of a version indicates whether the version is stable and whether it is
compatible with previous versions.

* The [major version](#glos-major-version) must be incremented and the minor
  and patch versions must be set to zero after a backwards incompatible change
  is made to the module's public interface or documented functionality, for
  example, after a package is removed.
* The [minor version](#glos-minor-version) must be incremented and the patch
  version set to zero after a backwards compatible change, for example, after a
  new function is added.
* The [patch version](#glos-patch-version) must be incremented after a change
  that does not affect the module's public interface, such as a bug fix or
  optimization.
* The pre-release suffix indicates a version is a
  [pre-release](#glos-pre-release-version). Pre-release versions sort before
  the corresponding release versions. For example, `v1.2.3-pre` comes before
  `v1.2.3`.
* The build metadata suffix is ignored for the purpose of comparing versions.
  Tags with build metadata are ignored in version control repositories, but
  build metadata is preserved in versions specified in `go.mod` files. The
  suffix `+incompatible` denotes a version released before migrating to modules
  version major version 2 or later (see [Compatibility with non-module
  repositories](#non-module-compat).

A version is considered unstable if its major version is 0 or it has a
pre-release suffix. Unstable versions are not subject to compatibility
requirements. For example, `v0.2.0` may not be compatible with `v0.1.0`, and
`v1.5.0-beta` may not be compatible with `v1.5.0`.

Go may access modules in version control systems using tags, branches, or
revisions that don't follow these conventions. However, within the main module,
the `go` command will automatically convert revision names that don't follow
this standard into canonical versions. The `go` command will also remove build
metadata suffixes (except for `+incompatible`) as part of this process. This may
result in a [pseudo-version](#glos-pseudo-version), a pre-release version that
encodes a revision identifier (such as a Git commit hash) and a timestamp from a
version control system. For example, the command `go get -d
golang.org/x/net@daa7c041` will convert the commit hash `daa7c041` into the
pseudo-version `v0.0.0-20191109021931-daa7c04131f5`. Canonical versions are
required outside the main module, and the `go` command will report an error if a
non-canonical version like `master` appears in a `go.mod` file.

### Pseudo-versions {#pseudo-versions}

A <dfn>pseudo-version</dfn> is a specially formatted
[pre-release](#glos-pre-release-version) [version](#glos-version) that encodes
information about a specific revision in a version control repository. For
example, `v0.0.0-20191109021931-daa7c04131f5` is a pseudo-version.

Pseudo-versions may refer to revisions for which no [semantic version
tags](#glos-semantic-version-tag) are available. They may be used to test
commits before creating version tags, for example, on a development branch.

Each pseudo-version has three parts:

* A base version prefix (`vX.0.0` or `vX.Y.Z-0`), which is either derived from a
  semantic version tag that precedes the revision or `vX.0.0` if there is no
  such tag.
* A timestamp (`yyyymmddhhmmss`), which is the UTC time the revision was
  created. In Git, this is the commit time, not the author time.
* A revision identifier (`abcdefabcdef`), which is a 12-character prefix of the
  commit hash, or in Subversion, a zero-padded revision number.

Each pseudo-version may be in one of three forms, depending on the base version.
These forms ensure that a pseudo-version compares higher than its base version,
but lower than the next tagged version.

* `vX.0.0-yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef` is used when there is no known base
  version. As with all versions, the major version `X` must match the module's
  [major version suffix](#glos-major-version-suffix).
* `vX.Y.Z-pre.0.yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef` is used when the base version is
  a pre-release version like `vX.Y.Z-pre`.
* `vX.Y.(Z+1)-0.yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef` is used when the base version is
  a release version like `vX.Y.Z`. For example, if the base version is
  `v1.2.3`, a pseudo-version might be `v1.2.4-0.20191109021931-daa7c04131f5`.

More than one pseudo-version may refer to the same commit by using different
base versions. This happens naturally when a lower version is tagged after a
pseudo-version is written.

These forms give pseudo-versions two useful properties:

* Pseudo-versions with known base versions sort higher than those versions but
  lower than other pre-release for later versions.
* Pseudo-versions with the same base version prefix sort chronologically.

The `go` command performs several checks to ensure that module authors have
control over how pseudo-versions are compared with other versions and that
pseudo-versions refer to revisions that are actually part of a module's
commit history.

* If a base version is specified, there must be a corresponding semantic version
  tag that is an ancestor of the revision described by the pseudo-version. This
  prevents developers from bypassing [minimal version
  selection](#glos-minimal-version-selection) using a pseudo-version that
  compares higher than all tagged versions like
  `v1.999.999-99999999999999-daa7c04131f5`.
* The timestamp must match the revision's timestamp. This prevents attackers
  from flooding [module proxies](#glos-module-proxy) with an unbounded number
  of otherwise identical pseudo-versions. This also prevents module consumers
  from changing the relative ordering of versions.
* The revision must be an ancestor of one of the module repository's branches or
  tags. This prevents attackers from referring to unapproved changes or pull
  requests.

Pseudo-versions never need to be typed by hand. Many commands accept
a commit hash or a branch name and will translate it into a pseudo-version
(or tagged version if available) automatically. For example:

```
go get -d example.com/mod@master
go list -m -json example.com/mod@abcd1234
```

### Major version suffixes {#major-version-suffixes}

Starting with major version 2, module paths must have a <dfn>major version
suffix</dfn> like `/v2` that matches the major version. For example, if a module
has the path `example.com/mod` at `v1.0.0`, it must have the path
`example.com/mod/v2` at version `v2.0.0`.

Major version suffixes implement the [<dfn>import compatibility
rule</dfn>](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import):

> If an old package and a new package have the same import path,
> the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.

By definition, packages in a new major version of a module are not backwards
compatible with the corresponding packages in the previous major version.
Consequently, starting with `v2`, packages need new import paths. This is
accomplished by adding a major version suffix to the module path. Since the
module path is a prefix of the import path for each package within the module,
adding the major version suffix to the module path provides a distinct import
path for each incompatible version.

Major version suffixes are not allowed at major versions `v0` or `v1`. There is
no need to change the module path between `v0` and `v1` because `v0` versions
are unstable and have no compatibility guarantee. Additionally, for most
modules, `v1` is backwards compatible with the last `v0` version; a `v1` version
acts as a commitment to compatibility, rather than an indication of
incompatible changes compared with `v0`.

As a special case, modules paths starting with `gopkg.in/` must always have a
major version suffix, even at `v0` and `v1`. The suffix must start with a dot
rather than a slash (for example, `gopkg.in/yaml.v2`).

Major version suffixes let multiple major versions of a module coexist in the
same build. This may be necessary due to a [diamond dependency
problem](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import#dependency_story). Ordinarily, if
a module is required at two different versions by transitive dependencies, the
higher version will be used. However, if the two versions are incompatible,
neither version will satisfy all clients. Since incompatible versions must have
different major version numbers, they must also have different module paths due
to major version suffixes. This resolves the conflict: modules with distinct
suffixes are treated as separate modules, and their packages—even packages in
same subdirectory relative to their module roots—are distinct.

Many Go projects released versions at `v2` or higher without using a major
version suffix before migrating to modules (perhaps before modules were even
introduced). These versions are annotated with a `+incompatible` build tag (for
example, `v2.0.0+incompatible`). See [Compatibility with non-module
repositories](#non-module-compat) for more information.

### Resolving a package to a module {#resolve-pkg-mod}

When the `go` command loads a package using a [package
path](#glos-package-path), it needs to determine which module provides the
package.

The `go` command starts by searching the [build list](#glos-build-list) for
modules with paths that are prefixes of the package path. For example, if the
package `example.com/a/b` is imported, and the module `example.com/a` is in the
build list, the `go` command will check whether `example.com/a` contains the
package, in the directory `b`. At least one file with the `.go` extension must
be present in a directory for it to be considered a package. [Build
constraints](/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints) are not applied for this
purpose. If exactly one module in the build list provides the package, that
module is used. If no modules provide the package or if two or more modules
provide the package, the `go` command reports an error. The `-mod=mod` flag
instructs the `go` command to attempt to find new modules providing missing
packages and to update `go.mod` and `go.sum`. The [`go get`](#go-get) and [`go
mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) commands do this automatically.

<!-- NOTE(golang.org/issue/27899): the go command reports an error when two
or more modules provide a package with the same path as above. In the future,
we may try to upgrade one (or all) of the colliding modules.
-->

When the `go` command looks up a new module for a package path, it checks the
`GOPROXY` environment variable, which is a comma-separated list of proxy URLs or
the keywords `direct` or `off`. A proxy URL indicates the `go` command should
contact a [module proxy](#glos-module-proxy) using the [`GOPROXY`
protocol](#goproxy-protocol). `direct` indicates that the `go` command should
[communicate with a version control system](#vcs). `off` indicates that no
communication should be attempted. The `GOPRIVATE` and `GONOPROXY` [environment
variables](#environment-variables) can also be used to control this behavior.

For each entry in the `GOPROXY` list, the `go` command requests the latest
version of each module path that might provide the package (that is, each prefix
of the package path). For each successfully requested module path, the `go`
command will download the module at the latest version and check whether the
module contains the requested package. If one or more modules contain the
requested package, the module with the longest path is used. If one or more
modules are found but none contain the requested package, an error is
reported. If no modules are found, the `go` command tries the next entry in the
`GOPROXY` list. If no entries are left, an error is reported.

For example, suppose the `go` command is looking for a module that provides the
package `golang.org/x/net/html`, and `GOPROXY` is set to
`https://corp.example.com,https://proxy.golang.org`. The `go` command may make
the following requests:

* To `https://corp.example.com/` (in parallel):
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org/x/net/html`
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org/x/net`
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org/x`
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org`
* To `https://proxy.golang.org/`, if all requests to `https://corp.example.com/`
  have failed with 404 or 410:
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org/x/net/html`
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org/x/net`
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org/x`
  * Request for latest version of `golang.org`

After a suitable module has been found, the `go` command will add a new
[requirement](#go-mod-file-require) with the new module's path and version to
the main module's `go.mod` file. This ensures that when the same package is
loaded in the future, the same module will be used at the same version. If the
resolved package is not imported by a package in the main module, the new
requirement will have an `// indirect` comment.

## `go.mod` files {#go-mod-file}

A module is defined by a UTF-8 encoded text file named `go.mod` in its root
directory. The `go.mod` file is line-oriented. Each line holds a single
directive, made up of a keyword followed by arguments. For example:

```
module example.com/my/thing

go 1.12

require example.com/other/thing v1.0.2
require example.com/new/thing/v2 v2.3.4
exclude example.com/old/thing v1.2.3
replace example.com/bad/thing v1.4.5 => example.com/good/thing v1.4.5
retract [v1.9.0, v1.9.5]
```

The leading keyword can be factored out of adjacent lines to create a block,
like in Go imports.

```
require (
    example.com/new/thing/v2 v2.3.4
    example.com/old/thing v1.2.3
)
```

The `go.mod` file is designed to be human readable and machine writable. The
`go` command provides several subcommands that change `go.mod` files. For
example, [`go get`](#go-get) can upgrade or downgrade specific dependencies.
Commands that load the module graph will [automatically
update](#go-mod-file-updates) `go.mod` when needed. [`go mod
edit`](#go-mod-edit) can perform low-level edits.  The
[`golang.org/x/mod/modfile`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/modfile?tab=doc)
package can be used by Go programs to make the same changes programmatically.

A `go.mod` file is required for the [main module](#glos-main-module), and for
any [replacement module](#go-mod-file-replace) specified with a local file path.
However, a module that lacks an explicit `go.mod` file may still be
[required](#go-mod-file-require) as a dependency, or used as a replacement
specified with a module path and version; see [Compatibility with non-module
repositories](#non-module-compat).

### Lexical elements {#go-mod-file-lexical}

When a `go.mod` file is parsed, its content is broken into a sequence of tokens.
There are several kinds of tokens: whitespace, comments, punctuation,
keywords, identifiers, and strings.

*White space* consists of spaces (U+0020), tabs (U+0009), carriage returns
(U+000D), and newlines (U+000A). White space characters other than newlines have
no effect except to separate tokens that would otherwise be combined. Newlines
are significant tokens.

*Comments* start with `//` and run to the end of a line. `/* */` comments are
not allowed.

*Punctuation* tokens include `(`, `)`, and `=>`.

*Keywords* distinguish different kinds of directives in a `go.mod` file. Allowed
keywords are `module`, `go`, `require`, `replace`, `exclude`, and `retract`.

*Identifiers* are sequences of non-whitespace characters, such as module paths
or semantic versions.

*Strings* are quoted sequences of characters. There are two kinds of strings:
interpreted strings beginning and ending with quotation marks (`"`, U+0022) and
raw strings beginning and ending with grave accents (<code>&#x60;</code>,
U+0060). Interpreted strings may contain escape sequences consisting of a
backslash (`\`, U+005C) followed by another character. An escaped quotation
mark (`\"`) does not terminate an interpreted string. The unquoted value
of an interpreted string is the sequence of characters between quotation
marks with each escape sequence replaced by the character following the
backslash (for example, `\"` is replaced by `"`, `\n` is replaced by `n`).
In contrast, the unquoted value of a raw string is simply the sequence of
characters between grave accents; backslashes have no special meaning within
raw strings.

Identifiers and strings are interchangeable in the `go.mod` grammar.

### Module paths and versions {#go-mod-file-ident}

Most identifiers and strings in a `go.mod` file are either module paths or
versions.

A module path must satisfy the following requirements:

* The path must consist of one or more path elements separated by slashes
  (`/`, U+002F). It must not begin or end with a slash.
* Each path element is a non-empty string made of up ASCII letters, ASCII
  digits, and limited ASCII punctuation (`-`, `.`, `_`, and `~`).
* A path element may not begin or end with a dot (`.`, U+002E).
* The element prefix up to the first dot must not be a reserved file name on
  Windows, regardless of case (`CON`, `com1`, `NuL`, and so on).
* The element prefix up to the first dot must not end with a tilde followed by
  one or more digits (like `EXAMPL~1.COM`).

If the module path appears in a `require` directive and is not replaced, or
if the module paths appears on the right side of a `replace` directive,
the `go` command may need to download modules with that path, and some
additional requirements must be satisfied.

* The leading path element (up to the first slash, if any), by convention a
  domain name, must contain only lower-case ASCII letters, ASCII digits, dots
  (`.`, U+002E), and dashes (`-`, U+002D); it must contain at least one dot and
  cannot start with a dash.
* For a final path element of the form `/vN` where `N` looks numeric (ASCII
  digits and dots), `N` must not begin with a leading zero, must not be `/v1`,
  and must not contain any dots.
  * For paths beginning with `gopkg.in/`, this requirement is replaced by a
    requirement that the path follow the [gopkg.in](https://gopkg.in) service's
    conventions.

Versions in `go.mod` files may be [canonical](#glos-canonical-version) or
non-canonical.

A canonical version starts with the letter `v`, followed by a semantic version
following the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
specification. See [Versions](#versions) for more information.

Most other identifiers and strings may be used as non-canonical versions, though
there are some restrictions to avoid problems with file systems, repositories,
and [module proxies](#glos-module-proxy). Non-canonical versions are only
allowed in the main module's `go.mod` file. The `go` command will attempt to
replace each non-canonical version with an equivalent canonical version when it
automatically [updates](#go-mod-file-updates) the `go.mod` file.

In places where a module path is associated with a version (as in `require`,
`replace`, and `exclude` directives), the final path element must be consistent
with the version. See [Major version suffixes](#major-version-suffixes).

### Grammar {#go-mod-file-grammar}

`go.mod` syntax is specified below using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).
See the [Notation section in the Go Language Specification](/ref/spec#Notation)
for details on EBNF syntax.

```
GoMod = { Directive } .
Directive = ModuleDirective |
            GoDirective |
            RequireDirective |
            ExcludeDirective |
            ReplaceDirective |
            RetractDirective .
```

Newlines, identifiers, and strings are denoted with `newline`, `ident`, and
`string`, respectively.

Module paths and versions are denoted with `ModulePath` and `Version`.

```
ModulePath = ident | string . /* see restrictions above */
Version = ident | string .    /* see restrictions above */
```

### `module` directive {#go-mod-file-module}

A `module` directive defines the main module's [path](#glos-module-path). A
`go.mod` file must contain exactly one `module` directive.

```
ModuleDirective = "module" ( ModulePath | "(" newline ModulePath newline ")" ) newline .
```

Example:

```
module golang.org/x/net
```

#### Deprecation {#go-mod-file-module-deprecation}

A module can be marked as deprecated in a block of comments containing the
string `Deprecated:` (case-sensitive) at the beginning of a paragraph. The
deprecation message starts after the colon and runs to the end of the paragraph.
The comments may appear immediately before the `module` directive or afterward
on the same line.

Example:

```
// Deprecated: use example.com/mod/v2 instead.
module example.com/mod
```

Since Go 1.17, [`go list -m -u`](#go-list-m) checks for information on all
deprecated modules in the [build list](#glos-build-list). [`go get`](#go-get)
checks for deprecated modules needed to build packages named on the command
line.

When the `go` command retrieves deprecation information for a module, it loads
the `go.mod` file from the version matching the `@latest` [version
query](#version-queries) without considering retractions or exclusions. The `go`
command loads [retractions](#glos-retracted-version) from the same `go.mod`
file.

To deprecate a module, an author may add a `// Deprecated:` comment and tag a
new release. The author may change or remove the deprecation message in a higher
release.

A deprecation applies to all minor versions of a module. Major versions higher
than `v2` are considered separate modules for this purpose, since their [major
version suffixes](#glos-major-version-suffix) give them distinct module paths.

Deprecation messages are intended to inform users that the module is no longer
supported and to provide migration instructions, for example, to the latest
major version. Individual minor and patch versions cannot be deprecated;
[`retract`](#go-mod-file-retract) may be more appropriate for that.

### `go` directive {#go-mod-file-go}

A `go` directive indicates that a module was written assuming the semantics of a
given version of Go. The version must be a valid Go release version: a positive
integer followed by a dot and a non-negative integer (for example, `1.9`,
`1.14`).

The `go` directive was originally intended to support backward incompatible
changes to the Go language (see [Go 2
transition](/design/28221-go2-transitions)). There have been no incompatible
language changes since modules were introduced, but the `go` directive still
affects use of new language features:

* For packages within the module, the compiler rejects use of language features
  introduced after the version specified by the `go` directive. For example, if
  a module has the directive `go 1.12`, its packages may not use numeric
  literals like `1_000_000`, which were introduced in Go 1.13.
* If an older Go version builds one of the module's packages and encounters a
  compile error, the error notes that the module was written for a newer Go
  version. For example, suppose a module has `go 1.13` and a package uses the
  numeric literal `1_000_000`. If that package is built with Go 1.12, the
  compiler notes that the code is written for Go 1.13.

Additionally, the `go` command changes its behavior based on the version
specified by the `go` directive. This has the following effects:

* At `go 1.14` or higher, automatic [vendoring](#vendoring) may be enabled.
  If the file `vendor/modules.txt` is present and consistent with `go.mod`,
  there is no need to explicitly use the `-mod=vendor` flag.
* At `go 1.16` or higher, the `all` package pattern matches only packages
  transitively imported by packages and tests in the [main
  module](#glos-main-module). This is the same set of packages retained by
  [`go mod vendor`](#go-mod-vendor) since modules were introduced. In lower
  versions, `all` also includes tests of packages imported by packages in
  the main module, tests of those packages, and so on.
* At `go 1.17` or higher:
   * The `go.mod` file includes an explicit [`require`
     directive](#go-mod-file-require) for each module that provides any package
     transitively imported by a package or test in the main module. (At `go
     1.16` and lower, an [indirect dependency](#glos-direct-dependency) is
     included only if [minimal version selection](#minimal-version-selection)
     would otherwise select a different version.) This extra information enables
     [module graph pruning](#graph-pruning) and [lazy module
     loading](#lazy-loading).
   * Because there may be many more `// indirect` dependencies than in previous
     `go` versions, indirect dependencies are recorded in a separate block
     within the `go.mod` file.
   * `go mod vendor` omits `go.mod` and `go.sum` files for vendored
     dependencies. (That allows invocations of the `go` command within
     subdirectories of `vendor` to identify the correct main module.)
   * `go mod vendor` records the `go` version from each dependency's `go.mod`
     file in `vendor/modules.txt`.
<!-- If you update this list, also update /doc/modules/gomod-ref#go-notes. -->

A `go.mod` file may contain at most one `go` directive. Most commands will add a
`go` directive with the current Go version if one is not present.

```
GoDirective = "go" GoVersion newline .
GoVersion = string | ident .  /* valid release version; see above */
```

Example:

```
go 1.14
```

### `require` directive {#go-mod-file-require}

A `require` directive declares a minimum required version of a given module
dependency. For each required module version, the `go` command loads the
`go.mod` file for that version and incorporates the requirements from that
file. Once all requirements have been loaded, the `go` command resolves them
using [minimal version selection (MVS)](#minimal-version-selection) to produce
the [build list](#glos-build-list).

The `go` command automatically adds `// indirect` comments for some
requirements. An `// indirect` comment indicates that no package from the
required module is directly imported by any package in the [main
module](#glos-main-module).

If the [`go` directive](#go-mod-file-go) specifies `go 1.16` or lower, the `go`
command adds an indirect requirement when the selected version of a module is
higher than what is already implied (transitively) by the main module's other
dependencies. That may occur because of an explicit upgrade (`go get -u ./...`),
removal of some other dependency that previously imposed the requirement (`go
mod tidy`), or a dependency that imports a package without a corresponding
requirement in its own `go.mod` file (such as a dependency that lacks a `go.mod`
file altogether).

At `go 1.17` and above, the `go` command adds an indirect requirement for each
module that provides any package imported (even
[indirectly](#glos-indirect-dependency)) by a package or test in the main module
or passed as an argument to `go get`. These more comprehensive requirements
enable [module graph pruning](#graph-pruning) and [lazy module
loading](#lazy-loading).

```
RequireDirective = "require" ( RequireSpec | "(" newline { RequireSpec } ")" newline ) .
RequireSpec = ModulePath Version newline .
```

Example:

```
require golang.org/x/net v1.2.3

require (
    golang.org/x/crypto v1.4.5 // indirect
    golang.org/x/text v1.6.7
)
```

### `exclude` directive {#go-mod-file-exclude}

An `exclude` directive prevents a module version from being loaded by the `go`
command.

Since Go 1.16, if a version referenced by a `require` directive in any `go.mod`
file is excluded by an `exclude` directive in the main module's `go.mod` file,
the requirement is ignored. This may be cause commands like [`go get`](#go-get)
and [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) to add new requirements on higher versions
to `go.mod`, with an `// indirect` comment if appropriate.

Before Go 1.16, if an excluded version was referenced by a `require` directive,
the `go` command listed available versions for the module (as shown with [`go
list -m -versions`](#go-list-m)) and loaded the next higher non-excluded version
instead. This could result in non-deterministic version selection, since the
next higher version could change over time. Both release and pre-release
versions were considered for this purpose, but pseudo-versions were not. If
there were no higher versions, the `go` command reported an error.

`exclude` directives only apply in the main module's `go.mod` file and are
ignored in other modules. See [Minimal version
selection](#minimal-version-selection) for details.

```
ExcludeDirective = "exclude" ( ExcludeSpec | "(" newline { ExcludeSpec } ")" newline ) .
ExcludeSpec = ModulePath Version newline .
```

Example:

```
exclude golang.org/x/net v1.2.3

exclude (
    golang.org/x/crypto v1.4.5
    golang.org/x/text v1.6.7
)
```

### `replace` directive {#go-mod-file-replace}

A `replace` directive replaces the contents of a specific version of a module,
or all versions of a module, with contents found elsewhere. The replacement
may be specified with either another module path and version, or a
platform-specific file path.

If a version is present on the left side of the arrow (`=>`), only that specific
version of the module is replaced; other versions will be accessed normally.
If the left version is omitted, all versions of the module are replaced.

If the path on the right side of the arrow is an absolute or relative path
(beginning with `./` or `../`), it is interpreted as the local file path to the
replacement module root directory, which must contain a `go.mod` file. The
replacement version must be omitted in this case.

If the path on the right side is not a local path, it must be a valid module
path. In this case, a version is required. The same module version must not
also appear in the build list.

Regardless of whether a replacement is specified with a local path or module
path, if the replacement module has a `go.mod` file, its `module` directive
must match the module path it replaces.

`replace` directives only apply in the main module's `go.mod` file
and are ignored in other modules. See [Minimal version
selection](#minimal-version-selection) for details.

Note that a `replace` directive alone does not add a module to the [module
graph](#glos-module-graph). A [`require` directive](#go-mod-file-require) that
refers to a replaced module version is also needed, either in the main module's
`go.mod` file or a dependency's `go.mod` file. A `replace` directive has no
effect if the module version on the left side is not required.

```
ReplaceDirective = "replace" ( ReplaceSpec | "(" newline { ReplaceSpec } ")" newline ) .
ReplaceSpec = ModulePath [ Version ] "=>" FilePath newline
            | ModulePath [ Version ] "=>" ModulePath Version newline .
FilePath = /* platform-specific relative or absolute file path */
```

Example:

```
replace golang.org/x/net v1.2.3 => example.com/fork/net v1.4.5

replace (
    golang.org/x/net v1.2.3 => example.com/fork/net v1.4.5
    golang.org/x/net => example.com/fork/net v1.4.5
    golang.org/x/net v1.2.3 => ./fork/net
    golang.org/x/net => ./fork/net
)
```

### `retract` directive {#go-mod-file-retract}

A `retract` directive indicates that a version or range of versions of the
module defined by `go.mod` should not be depended upon. A `retract` directive is
useful when a version was published prematurely or a severe problem was
discovered after the version was published. Retracted versions should remain
available in version control repositories and on [module
proxies](#glos-module-proxy) to ensure that builds that depend on them are not
broken. The word *retract* is borrowed from academic literature: a retracted
research paper is still available, but it has problems and should not be the
basis of future work.

When a module version is retracted, users will not upgrade to it automatically
using [`go get`](#go-get), [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy), or other
commands. Builds that depend on retracted versions should continue to work, but
users will be notified of retractions when they check for updates with [`go list
-m -u`](#go-list-m) or update a related module with [`go get`](#go-get).

To retract a version, a module author should add a `retract` directive to
`go.mod`, then publish a new version containing that directive. The new version
must be higher than other release or pre-release versions; that is, the
`@latest` [version query](#version-queries) should resolve to the new version
before retractions are considered. The `go` command loads and applies
retractions from the version shown by `go list -m -retracted $modpath@latest`
(where `$modpath` is the module path).

Retracted versions are hidden from the version list printed by [`go list -m
-versions`](#go-list-m) unless the `-retracted` flag is used. Retracted
versions are excluded when resolving version queries like `@>=v1.2.3` or
`@latest`.

A version containing retractions may retract itself. If the highest release
or pre-release version of a module retracts itself, the `@latest` query
resolves to a lower version after retracted versions are excluded.

As an example, consider a case where the author of module `example.com/m`
publishes version `v1.0.0` accidentally. To prevent users from upgrading to
`v1.0.0`, the author can add two `retract` directives to `go.mod`, then tag
`v1.0.1` with the retractions.

```
retract (
	v1.0.0 // Published accidentally.
	v1.0.1 // Contains retractions only.
)
```

When a user runs `go get example.com/m@latest`, the `go` command reads
retractions from `v1.0.1`, which is now the highest version. Both `v1.0.0` and
`v1.0.1` are retracted, so the `go` command will upgrade (or downgrade!) to
the next highest version, perhaps `v0.9.5`.

`retract` directives may be written with either a single version (like `v1.0.0`)
or with a closed interval of versions with an upper and lower bound, delimited by
`[` and `]` (like `[v1.1.0, v1.2.0]`). A single version is equivalent to an
interval where the upper and lower bound are the same. Like other directives,
multiple `retract` directives may be grouped together in a block delimited by
`(` at the end of a line and `)` on its own line.

Each `retract` directive should have a comment explaining the rationale for the
retraction, though this is not mandatory. The `go` command may display rationale
comments in warnings about retracted versions and in `go list` output. A
rationale comment may be written immediately above a `retract` directive
(without a blank line in between) or afterward on the same line. If a comment
appears above a block, it applies to all `retract` directives within the block
that don't have their own comments. A rationale comment may span multiple lines.

```
RetractDirective = "retract" ( RetractSpec | "(" newline { RetractSpec } ")" newline ) .
RetractSpec = ( Version | "[" Version "," Version "]" ) newline .
```

Example:

```
retract v1.0.0
retract [v1.0.0, v1.9.9]
retract (
    v1.0.0
    [v1.0.0, v1.9.9]
)
```

The `retract` directive was added in Go 1.16. Go 1.15 and lower will report an
error if a `retract` directive is written in the [main
module's](#glos-main-module) `go.mod` file and will ignore `retract` directives
in `go.mod` files of dependencies.

### Automatic updates {#go-mod-file-updates}

Most commands report an error if `go.mod` is missing information or doesn't
accurately reflect reality. The [`go get`](#go-get) and
[`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) commands may be used to fix most of these
problems. Additionally, the `-mod=mod` flag may be used with most module-aware
commands (`go build`, `go test`, and so on) to instruct the `go` command to
fix problems in `go.mod` and `go.sum` automatically.

For example, consider this `go.mod` file:

```
module example.com/M

go 1.16

require (
    example.com/A v1
    example.com/B v1.0.0
    example.com/C v1.0.0
    example.com/D v1.2.3
    example.com/E dev
)

exclude example.com/D v1.2.3
```

The update triggered with `-mod=mod` rewrites non-canonical version identifiers
to [canonical](#glos-canonical-version) semver form, so `example.com/A`'s `v1`
becomes `v1.0.0`, and `example.com/E`'s `dev` becomes the pseudo-version for the
latest commit on the `dev` branch, perhaps `v0.0.0-20180523231146-b3f5c0f6e5f1`.

The update modifies requirements to respect exclusions, so the requirement on
the excluded `example.com/D v1.2.3` is updated to use the next available version
of `example.com/D`, perhaps `v1.2.4` or `v1.3.0`.

The update removes redundant or misleading requirements. For example, if
`example.com/A v1.0.0` itself requires `example.com/B v1.2.0` and `example.com/C
v1.0.0`, then `go.mod`'s requirement of `example.com/B v1.0.0` is misleading
(superseded by `example.com/A`'s need for `v1.2.0`), and its requirement of
`example.com/C v1.0.0` is redundant (implied by `example.com/A`'s need for the
same version), so both will be removed. If the main module contains packages
that directly import packages from `example.com/B` or `example.com/C`, then the
requirements will be kept but updated to the actual versions being used.

Finally, the update reformats the `go.mod` in a canonical formatting, so
that future mechanical changes will result in minimal diffs. The `go` command
will not update `go.mod` if only formatting changes are needed.

Because the module graph defines the meaning of import statements, any commands
that load packages also use `go.mod` and can therefore update it, including
`go build`, `go get`, `go install`, `go list`, `go test`, `go mod tidy`.

In Go 1.15 and lower, the `-mod=mod` flag was enabled by default, so updates
were performed automatically. Since Go 1.16, the `go` command acts as
if `-mod=readonly` were set instead: if any changes to `go.mod` are needed,
the `go` command reports an error and suggests a fix.

## Minimal version selection (MVS) {#minimal-version-selection}

Go uses an algorithm called <dfn>Minimal version selection (MVS)</dfn> to select
a set of module versions to use when building packages. MVS is described in
detail in [Minimal Version Selection](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs) by
Russ Cox.

Conceptually, MVS operates on a directed graph of modules, specified with
[`go.mod` files](#glos-go-mod-file). Each vertex in the graph represents a
module version. Each edge represents a minimum required version of a dependency,
specified using a [`require`](#go-mod-file-require)
directive. [`replace`](#go-mod-file-replace) and [`exclude`](#go-mod-file-exclude)
directives in the main module's `go.mod` file modify the graph.

MVS produces the [build list](#glos-build-list) as output, the list of module
versions used for a build.

MVS starts at the main module (a special vertex in the graph that has no
version) and traverses the graph, tracking the highest required version of each
module. At the end of the traversal, the highest required versions comprise the
build list: they are the minimum versions that satisfy all requirements.

The build list may be inspected with the command [`go list -m
all`](#go-list-m). Unlike other dependency management systems, the build list is
not saved in a "lock" file. MVS is deterministic, and the build list doesn't
change when new versions of dependencies are released, so MVS is used to compute
it at the beginning of every module-aware command.

Consider the example in the diagram below. The main module requires module A
at version 1.2 or higher and module B at version 1.2 or higher. A 1.2 and B 1.2
require C 1.3 and C 1.4, respectively. C 1.3 and C 1.4 both require D 1.2.

![Module version graph with visited versions highlighted](/doc/mvs/buildlist.svg "MVS build list graph")

MVS visits and loads the `go.mod` file for each of the module versions
highlighted in blue. At the end of the graph traversal, MVS returns a build list
containing the bolded versions: A 1.2, B 1.2, C 1.4, and D 1.2. Note that higher
versions of B and D are available but MVS does not select them, since nothing
requires them.

### Replacement {#mvs-replace}

The content of a module (including its `go.mod` file) may be replaced using a
[`replace` directive](#go-mod-file-replace) in the main module's `go.mod` file.
A `replace` directive may apply to a specific version of a module or to all
versions of a module.

Replacements change the module graph, since a replacement module may have
different dependencies than replaced versions.

Consider the example below, where C 1.4 has been replaced with R. R depends on D
1.3 instead of D 1.2, so MVS returns a build list containing A 1.2, B 1.2, C 1.4
(replaced with R), and D 1.3.

![Module version graph with a replacement](/doc/mvs/replace.svg "MVS replacment")

### Exclusion {#mvs-exclude}

A module may also be excluded at specific versions using an [`exclude`
directive](#go-mod-file-exclude) in the main module's `go.mod` file.

Exclusions also change the module graph. When a version is excluded, it is
removed from the module graph, and requirements on it are redirected to the
next higher version.

Consider the example below. C 1.3 has been excluded. MVS will act as if A 1.2
required C 1.4 (the next higher version) instead of C 1.3.

![Module version graph with an exclusion](/doc/mvs/exclude.svg "MVS exclude")

### Upgrades {#mvs-upgrade}

The [`go get`](#go-get) command may be used to upgrade a set of modules. To
perform an upgrade, the `go` command changes the module graph before running MVS
by adding edges from visited versions to upgraded versions.

Consider the example below. Module B may be upgraded from 1.2 to 1.3, C may be
upgraded from 1.3 to 1.4, and D may be upgraded from 1.2 to 1.3.

![Module version graph with upgrades](/doc/mvs/upgrade.svg "MVS upgrade")

Upgrades (and downgrades) may add or remove indirect dependencies. In this case,
E 1.1 and F 1.1 appear in the build list after the upgrade, since E 1.1 is
required by B 1.3.

To preserve upgrades, the `go` command updates the requirements in `go.mod`.  It
will change the requirement on B to version 1.3. It will also add requirements
on C 1.4 and D 1.3 with `// indirect` comments, since those versions would not
be selected otherwise.

### Downgrade {#mvs-downgrade}

The [`go get`](#go-get) command may also be used to downgrade a set of
modules. To perform a downgrade, the `go` command changes the module graph by
removing versions above the downgraded versions. It also removes versions of
other modules that depend on removed versions, since they may not be compatible
with the downgraded versions of their dependencies. If the main module requires
a module version removed by downgrading, the requirement is changed to a
previous version that has not been removed. If no previous version is available,
the requirement is dropped.

Consider the example below. Suppose that a problem was found with C 1.4, so we
downgrade to C 1.3. C 1.4 is removed from the module graph. B 1.2 is also
removed, since it requires C 1.4 or higher. The main module's requirement on B
is changed to 1.1.

![Module version graph with downgrade](/doc/mvs/downgrade.svg "MVS downgrade")

[`go get`](#go-get) can also remove dependencies entirely, using an `@none`
suffix after an argument. This works similarly to a downgrade. All versions
of the named module are removed from the module graph.

## Module graph pruning {#graph-pruning}

If the main module is at `go 1.17` or higher, the [module
graph](#glos-module-graph) used for [minimal version
selection](#minimal-version-selection) includes only the _immediate_
requirements for each module dependency that specifies `go 1.17` or higher in
its own `go.mod` file, unless that version of the module is also (transitively)
required by some _other_ dependency at `go 1.16` or below. (The _transitive_
dependencies of `go 1.17` dependencies are _pruned out_ of the module graph.)

Since a `go 1.17` `go.mod` file includes a [require
directive](#go-mod-file-require) for every dependency needed to build any
package or test in that module, the pruned module graph includes all of the
dependencies needed to `go build` or `go test` the packages in any dependency
explicitly required by the [main module](#glos-main-module). A module that is
_not_ needed to build any package or test in a given module cannot affect the
run-time behavior of its packages, so the dependencies that are pruned out of
the module graph would only cause interference between otherwise-unrelated
modules.

Modules whose requirements have been pruned out still appear in the module graph
and are still reported by `go list -m all`: their [selected
versions](#glos-selected-version) are known and well-defined, and packages can
be loaded from those modules (for example, as transitive dependencies of tests
loaded from other modules). However, since the `go` command cannot easily
identify which dependencies of these modules are satisfied, the arguments to `go
build` and `go test` cannot include packages from modules whose requirements
have been pruned out. [`go get`](#go-get) promotes the module containing each
named package to an explicit dependency, allowing `go build` or `go test` to be
invoked on that package.

Because Go 1.16 and earlier did not support module graph pruning, the full
transitive closure of dependencies — including transitive `go 1.17`
dependencies — is still included for each module that specifies `go 1.16` or
lower. (At `go 1.16` and below, the `go.mod` file includes only
[direct dependencies](#glos-direct-dependency), so a much larger graph must be
loaded to ensure that all indirect dependencies are included.)

The [`go.sum` file](#go-sum-files) recorded by [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) for
a module by default includes checksums needed by the Go version _one below_ the
version specified in its [`go` directive](#go-mod-file-go). So a `go 1.17`
module includes checksums needed for the full module graph loaded by Go 1.16,
but a `go 1.18` module will include only the checksums needed for the pruned
module graph loaded by Go 1.17. The `-compat` flag can be used to override the
default version (for example, to prune the `go.sum` file more aggressively in a
`go 1.17` module).

See [the design document](/design/36460-lazy-module-loading) for more detail.

### Lazy module loading {#lazy-loading}

The more comprehensive requirements added for module graph pruning also enable
another optimization when working within a module. If the main module is at
`go 1.17` or higher, the `go` command avoids loading the complete module graph
until (and unless) it is needed. Instead, it loads only the main module's
`go.mod` file, then attempts to load the packages to be built using only those
requirements. If a package to be imported (for example, a dependency of a test
for a package outside the main module) is not found among those requirements,
then the rest of the module graph is loaded on demand.

If all imported packages can be found without loading the module graph, the
`go` command then loads the `go.mod` files for _only_ the modules containing
those packages, and their requirements are checked against the requirements of
the main module to ensure that they are locally consistent. (Inconsistencies can
arise due to version-control merges, hand-edits, and changes in modules that
have been [replaced](#go-mod-file-replace) using local filesystem paths.)

## Compatibility with non-module repositories {#non-module-compat}

To ensure a smooth transition from `GOPATH` to modules, the `go` command can
download and build packages in module-aware mode from repositories that have not
migrated to modules by adding a [`go.mod` file](#glos-go-mod-file).

When the `go` command downloads a module at a given version [directly](#vcs)
from a repository, it looks up a repository URL for the module path, maps the
version to a revision within the repository, then extracts an archive of the
repository at that revision. If the [module's path](#glos-module-path) is equal
to the [repository root path](#glos-repository-root-path), and the repository
root directory does not contain a `go.mod` file, the `go` command synthesizes a
`go.mod` file in the module cache that contains a [`module`
directive](#go-mod-file-module) and nothing else. Since synthetic `go.mod` files
do not contain [`require` directives](#go-mod-file-require) for their
dependencies, other modules that depend on them may need additional `require`
directives (with `// indirect` comments) to ensure each dependency is fetched at
the same version on every build.

When the `go` command downloads a module from a
[proxy](#communicating-with-proxies), it downloads the `go.mod` file separately
from the rest of the module content. The proxy is expected to serve a synthetic
`go.mod` file if the original module didn't have one.

### `+incompatible` versions {#incompatible-versions}

A module released at major version 2 or higher must have a matching [major
version suffix](#major-version-suffixes) on its module path. For example, if a
module is released at `v2.0.0`, its path must have a `/v2` suffix. This allows
the `go` command to treat multiple major versions of a project as distinct
modules, even if they're developed in the same repository.

The major version suffix requirement was introduced when module support was
added to the `go` command, and many repositories had already tagged releases
with major version `2` or higher before that. To maintain compatibility with
these repositories, the `go` command adds an `+incompatible` suffix to versions
with major version 2 or higher without a `go.mod` file. `+incompatible`
indicates that a version is part of the same module as versions with lower major
version numbers; consequently, the `go` command may automatically upgrade to
higher `+incompatible` versions even though it may break the build.

Consider the example requirement below:

```
require example.com/m v4.1.2+incompatible
```

The version `v4.1.2+incompatible` refers to the [semantic version
tag](#glos-semantic-version-tag) `v4.1.2` in the repository that provides the
module `example.com/m`. The module must be in the repository root directory
(that is, the [repository root path](#glos-module-path) must also be
`example.com/m`), and a `go.mod` file must not be present. The module may have
versions with lower major version numbers like `v1.5.2`, and the `go` command
may upgrade automatically to `v4.1.2+incompatible` from those versions (see
[minimal version selection (MVS)](#minimal-version-selection) for information
on how upgrades work).

A repository that migrates to modules after version `v2.0.0` is tagged should
usually release a new major version. In the example above, the author should
create a module with the path `example.com/m/v5` and should release version
`v5.0.0`. The author should also update imports of packages in the module to use
the prefix `example.com/m/v5` instead of `example.com/m`. See [Go Modules: v2
and Beyond](https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules) for a more detailed example.

Note that the `+incompatible` suffix should not appear on a tag in a repository;
a tag like `v4.1.2+incompatible` will be ignored. The suffix only appears in
versions used by the `go` command. See [Mapping versions to
commits](#vcs-version) for details on the distinction between versions and tags.

Note also that the `+incompatible` suffix may appear on
[pseudo-versions](#glos-pseudo-version). For example,
`v2.0.1-20200722182040-012345abcdef+incompatible` may be a valid pseudo-version.

### Minimal module compatibility {#minimal-module-compatibility}

A module released at major version 2 or higher is required to have a [major
version suffix](#glos-major-version-suffix) on its [module
path](#glos-module-path). The module may or may not be developed in a [major
version subdirectory](#glos-major-version-subdirectory) within its repository.
This has implications for packages that import packages within the module when
building `GOPATH` mode.

Normally in `GOPATH` mode, a package is stored in a directory matching its
[repository's root path](#glos-repository-root-path) joined with its directory
within the repository. For example, a package in the repository with root path
`example.com/repo` in the subdirectory `sub` would be stored in
`$GOPATH/src/example.com/repo/sub` and would be imported as
`example.com/repo/sub`.

For a module with a major version suffix, one might expect to find the package
`example.com/repo/v2/sub` in the directory
`$GOPATH/src/example.com/repo/v2/sub`. This would require the module to be
developed in the `v2` subdirectory of its repository. The `go` command supports
this but does not require it (see [Mapping versions to commits](#vcs-version)).

If a module is *not* developed in a major version subdirectory, then its
directory in `GOPATH` will not contain the major version suffix, and its
packages may be imported without the major version suffix. In the example above,
the package would be found in the directory `$GOPATH/src/example.com/repo/sub`
and would be imported as `example.com/repo/sub`.

This creates a problem for packages intended to be built in both module mode
and `GOPATH` mode: module mode requires a suffix, while `GOPATH` mode does not.

To fix this, <dfn>minimal module compatibility</dfn> was added in Go 1.11 and
was backported to Go 1.9.7 and 1.10.3. When an import path is resolved to a
directory in `GOPATH` mode:

* When resolving an import of the form `$modpath/$vn/$dir` where:
  * `$modpath` is a valid module path,
  * `$vn` is a major version suffix,
  * `$dir` is a possibly empty subdirectory,
* If all of the following are true:
  * The package `$modpath/$vn/$dir` is not present in any relevant [`vendor`
    directory](#glos-vendor-directory).
  * A `go.mod` file is present in the same directory as the importing file
    or in any parent directory up to the `$GOPATH/src` root,
  * No `$GOPATH[i]/src/$modpath/$vn/$suffix` directory exists (for any root
    `$GOPATH[i]`),
  * The file `$GOPATH[d]/src/$modpath/go.mod` exists (for some root
    `$GOPATH[d]`) and declares the module path as `$modpath/$vn`,
* Then the import of `$modpath/$vn/$dir` is resolved to the directory
  `$GOPATH[d]/src/$modpath/$dir`.

This rules allow packages that have been migrated to modules to import other
packages that have been migrated to modules when built in `GOPATH` mode even
when a major version subdirectory was not used.

## Module-aware commands {#mod-commands}

Most `go` commands may run in *Module-aware mode* or *`GOPATH` mode*. In
module-aware mode, the `go` command uses `go.mod` files to find versioned
dependencies, and it typically loads packages out of the [module
cache](#glos-module-cache), downloading modules if they are missing. In `GOPATH`
mode, the `go` command ignores modules; it looks in [`vendor`
directories](#glos-vendor-directory) and in `GOPATH` to find dependencies.

As of Go 1.16, module-aware mode is enabled by default, regardless of whether a
`go.mod` file is present. In lower versions, module-aware mode was enabled when
a `go.mod` file was present in the current directory or any parent directory.

Module-aware mode may be controlled with the `GO111MODULE` environment variable,
which can be set to `on`, `off`, or `auto`.

* If `GO111MODULE=off`, the `go` command ignores `go.mod` files and runs in
  `GOPATH` mode.
* If `GO111MODULE=on` or is unset, the `go` command runs in module-aware mode,
  even when no `go.mod` file is present. Not all commands work without a
  `go.mod` file: see [Module commands outside a module](#commands-outside).
* If `GO111MODULE=auto`, the `go` command runs in module-aware mode if a
  `go.mod` file is present in the current directory or any parent directory.
  In Go 1.15 and lower, this was the default behavior. `go mod` subcommands
  and `go install` with a [version query](#version-queries) run in module-aware
  mode even if no `go.mod` file is present.

In module-aware mode, `GOPATH` no longer defines the meaning of imports during a
build, but it still stores downloaded dependencies (in `GOPATH/pkg/mod`; see
[Module cache](#module-cache)) and installed commands (in `GOPATH/bin`, unless
`GOBIN` is set).

### Build commands {#build-commands}

All commands that load information about packages are module-aware. This
includes:

* `go build`
* `go fix`
* `go generate`
* `go get`
* `go install`
* `go list`
* `go run`
* `go test`
* `go vet`

When run in module-aware mode, these commands use `go.mod` files to interpret
import paths listed on the command line or written in Go source files. These
commands accept the following flags, common to all module commands.

* The `-mod` flag controls whether `go.mod` may be automatically updated and
  whether the `vendor` directory is used.
  * `-mod=mod` tells the `go` command to ignore the vendor directory and to
     [automatically update](#go-mod-file-updates) `go.mod`, for example, when an
     imported package is not provided by any known module.
  * `-mod=readonly` tells the `go` command to ignore the `vendor` directory and
    to report an error if `go.mod` needs to be updated.
  * `-mod=vendor` tells the `go` command to use the `vendor` directory. In this
    mode, the `go` command will not use the network or the module cache.
  * By default, if the [`go` version](#go-mod-file-go) in `go.mod` is `1.14` or
    higher and a `vendor` directory is present, the `go` command acts as if
    `-mod=vendor` were used. Otherwise, the `go` command acts as if
    `-mod=readonly` were used.
* The `-modcacherw` flag instructs the `go` command to create new directories
  in the module cache with read-write permissions instead of making them
  read-only. When this flag is used consistently (typically by setting
  `GOFLAGS=-modcacherw` in the environment or by running
  `go env -w GOFLAGS=-modcacherw`), the module cache may be deleted with
  commands like `rm -r` without changing permissions first. The
  [`go clean -modcache`](#go-clean-modcache) command may be used to delete the
  module cache, whether or not `-modcacherw` was used.
* The `-modfile=file.mod` flag instructs the `go` command to read (and possibly
  write) an alternate file instead of `go.mod` in the module root directory. The
  file's name must end with `.mod`. A file named `go.mod` must still be present
  in order to determine the module root directory, but it is not accessed. When
  `-modfile` is specified, an alternate `go.sum` file is also used: its path is
  derived from the `-modfile` flag by trimming the `.mod` extension and
  appending `.sum`.

### Vendoring {#vendoring}

When using modules, the `go` command typically satisfies dependencies by
downloading modules from their sources into the module cache, then loading
packages from those downloaded copies. <dfn>Vendoring</dfn> may be used to allow
interoperation with older versions of Go, or to ensure that all files used for a
build are stored in a single file tree.

The [`go mod vendor`](#go-mod-vendor) command constructs a directory named
`vendor` in the [main module's](#glos-main-module) root directory containing
copies of all packages needed to build and test packages in the main module.
Packages that are only imported by tests of packages outside the main module are
not included. As with [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) and other module commands,
[build constraints](#glos-build-constraint) except for `ignore` are not
considered when constructing the `vendor` directory.

`go mod vendor` also creates the file `vendor/modules.txt` that contains a list
of vendored packages and the module versions they were copied from. When
vendoring is enabled, this manifest is used as a source of module version
information, as reported by [`go list -m`](#go-list-m) and [`go version
-m`](#go-version-m). When the `go` command reads `vendor/modules.txt`, it checks
that the module versions are consistent with `go.mod`. If `go.mod` has changed
since `vendor/modules.txt` was generated, the `go` command will report an error.
`go mod vendor` should be run again to update the `vendor` directory.

If the `vendor` directory is present in the main module's root directory, it
will be used automatically if the [`go` version](#go-mod-file-go) in the main
module's [`go.mod` file](#glos-go-mod-file) is `1.14` or higher. To explicitly
enable vendoring, invoke the `go` command with the flag `-mod=vendor`. To
disable vendoring, use the flag `-mod=readonly` or `-mod=mod`.

When vendoring is enabled, [build commands](#build-commands) like `go build` and
`go test` load packages from the `vendor` directory instead of accessing the
network or the local module cache. The [`go list -m`](#go-list-m) command only
prints information about modules listed in `go.mod`. `go mod` commands such as
[`go mod download`](#go-mod-download) and [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) do not
work differently when vendoring is enabled and will still download modules and
access the module cache. [`go get`](#go-get) also does not work differently when
vendoring is enabled.

Unlike [vendoring in `GOPATH` mode](https://golang.org/s/go15vendor), the `go`
command ignores vendor directories in locations other than the main module's
root directory. Additionally, since vendor directories in other modules are not
used, the `go` command does not include vendor directories when building [module
zip files](#zip-files) (but see known bugs
[#31562](https://golang.org/issue/31562) and
[#37397](https://golang.org/issue/37397)).

### `go get` {#go-get}

Usage:

```
go get [-d] [-t] [-u] [build flags] [packages]
```

Examples:

```
# Upgrade a specific module.
$ go get -d golang.org/x/net

# Upgrade modules that provide packages imported by packages in the main module.
$ go get -d -u ./...

# Upgrade or downgrade to a specific version of a module.
$ go get -d golang.org/x/text@v0.3.2

# Update to the commit on the module's master branch.
$ go get -d golang.org/x/text@master

# Remove a dependency on a module and downgrade modules that require it
# to versions that don't require it.
$ go get -d golang.org/x/text@none
```

The `go get` command updates module dependencies in the [`go.mod`
file](#go-mod-file) for the [main module](#glos-main-module), then builds and
installs packages listed on the command line.

The first step is to determine which modules to update. `go get` accepts a list
of packages, package patterns, and module paths as arguments. If a package
argument is specified, `go get` updates the module that provides the package.
If a package pattern is specified (for example, `all` or a path with a `...`
wildcard), `go get` expands the pattern to a set of packages, then updates the
modules that provide the packages. If an argument names a module but not a
package (for example, the module `golang.org/x/net` has no package in its root
directory), `go get` will update the module but will not build a package. If no
arguments are specified, `go get` acts as if `.` were specified (the package in
the current directory); this may be used together with the `-u` flag to update
modules that provide imported packages.

Each argument may include a <dfn>version query suffix</dfn> indicating the
desired version, as in `go get golang.org/x/text@v0.3.0`. A version query
suffix consists of an `@` symbol followed by a [version query](#version-queries),
which may indicate a specific version (`v0.3.0`), a version prefix (`v0.3`),
a branch or tag name (`master`), a revision (`1234abcd`), or one of the special
queries `latest`, `upgrade`, `patch`, or `none`. If no version is given,
`go get` uses the `@upgrade` query.

Once `go get` has resolved its arguments to specific modules and versions, `go
get` will add, change, or remove [`require` directives](#go-mod-file-require) in
the main module's `go.mod` file to ensure the modules remain at the desired
versions in the future. Note that required versions in `go.mod` files are
*minimum versions* and may be increased automatically as new dependencies are
added. See [Minimal version selection (MVS)](#minimal-version-selection) for
details on how versions are selected and conflicts are resolved by module-aware
commands.

Other modules may be upgraded when a module named on the command line is added,
upgraded, or downgraded if the new version of the named module requires other
modules at higher versions. For example, suppose module `example.com/a` is
upgraded to version `v1.5.0`, and that version requires module `example.com/b`
at version `v1.2.0`. If module `example.com/b` is currently required at version
`v1.1.0`, `go get example.com/a@v1.5.0` will also upgrade `example.com/b` to
`v1.2.0`.

![go get upgrading a transitive requirement](/doc/mvs/get-upgrade.svg)

Other modules may be downgraded when a module named on the command line is
downgraded or removed. To continue the above example, suppose module
`example.com/b` is downgraded to `v1.1.0`. Module `example.com/a` would also be
downgraded to a version that requires `example.com/b` at version `v1.1.0` or
lower.

![go get downgrading a transitive requirement](/doc/mvs/get-downgrade.svg)

A module requirement may be removed using the version suffix `@none`. This is a
special kind of downgrade. Modules that depend on the removed module will be
downgraded or removed as needed. A module requirement may be removed even if one
or more of its packages are imported by packages in the main module. In this
case, the next build command may add a new module requirement.

If a module is needed at two different versions (specified explicitly in command
line arguments or to satisfy upgrades and downgrades), `go get` will report an
error.

After `go get` has selected a new set of versions, it checks whether any newly
selected module versions or any modules providing packages named on the command
line are [retracted](#glos-retracted-version) or
[deprecated](#glos-deprecated-module). `go get` prints a warning for each
retracted version or deprecated module it finds. [`go list -m -u
all`](#go-list-m) may be used to check for retractions and deprecations in all
dependencies.

After `go get` updates the `go.mod` file, it builds the packages named
on the command line. Executables will be installed in the directory named by
the `GOBIN` environment variable, which defaults to `$GOPATH/bin` or
`$HOME/go/bin` if the `GOPATH` environment variable is not set.

`go get` supports the following flags:

* The `-d` flag tells `go get` not to build or install packages. When `-d` is
  used, `go get` will only manage dependencies in `go.mod`. Using `go get`
  without `-d` to build and install packages is deprecated (as of Go 1.17).
  In Go 1.18, `-d` will always be enabled.
* The `-u` flag tells `go get` to upgrade modules providing packages
  imported directly or indirectly by packages named on the command line.
  Each module selected by `-u` will be upgraded to its latest version unless
  it is already required at a higher version (a pre-release).
* The `-u=patch` flag (not `-u patch`) also tells `go get` to upgrade
  dependencies, but `go get` will upgrade each dependency to the latest patch
  version (similar to the `@patch` version query).
* The `-t` flag tells `go get` to consider modules needed to build tests
  of packages named on the command line. When `-t` and `-u` are used together,
  `go get` will update test dependencies as well.
* The `-insecure` flag should no longer be used. It permits `go get` to resolve
  custom import paths and fetch from repositories and module proxies using
  insecure schemes such as HTTP. The `GOINSECURE` [environment
  variable](#environment-variables) provides more fine-grained control and
  should be used instead.

Since Go 1.16, [`go install`](#go-install) is the recommended command for
building and installing programs. When used with a version suffix (like
`@latest` or `@v1.4.6`), `go install` builds packages in module-aware mode,
ignoring the `go.mod` file in the current directory or any parent directory,
if there is one.

`go get` is more focused on managing requirements in `go.mod`. The `-d` flag
is deprecated, and in Go 1.18, it will always be enabled.

### `go install` {#go-install}

Usage:

```
go install [build flags] [packages]
```

Examples:

```
# Install the latest version of a program,
# ignoring go.mod in the current directory (if any).
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest

# Install a specific version of a program.
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@v0.6.4

# Install a program at the version selected by the module in the current directory.
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls

# Install all programs in a directory.
$ go install ./cmd/...
```

The `go install` command builds and installs the packages named by the paths
on the command line. Executables (`main` packages) are installed to the
directory named by the `GOBIN` environment variable, which defaults to
`$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` if the `GOPATH` environment variable is not set.
Executables in `$GOROOT` are installed in `$GOROOT/bin` or `$GOTOOLDIR` instead
of `$GOBIN`. Non-executable packages are built and cached but not installed.

Since Go 1.16, if the arguments have version suffixes (like `@latest` or
`@v1.0.0`), `go install` builds packages in module-aware mode, ignoring the
`go.mod` file in the current directory or any parent directory if there is
one. This is useful for installing executables without affecting the
dependencies of the main module.

To eliminate ambiguity about which module versions are used in the build, the
arguments must satisfy the following constraints:

* Arguments must be package paths or package patterns (with "`...`" wildcards).
  They must not be standard packages (like `fmt`), meta-patterns (`std`, `cmd`,
  `all`), or relative or absolute file paths.
* All arguments must have the same version suffix. Different queries are not
  allowed, even if they refer to the same version.
* All arguments must refer to packages in the same module at the same version.
* Package path arguments must refer to `main` packages. Pattern arguments
  will only match `main` packages.
* No module is considered the [main module](#glos-main-module).
  * If the module containing packages named on the command line has a `go.mod`
    file, it must not contain directives (`replace` and `exclude`) that would
    cause it to be interpreted differently if it were the main module.
  * The module must not require a higher version of itself.
  * Vendor directories are not used in any module. (Vendor directories are not
    included in [module zip files](#zip-files), so `go install` does not
    download them.)

See [Version queries](#version-queries) for supported version query syntax.
Go 1.15 and lower did not support using version queries with `go install`.

If the arguments don't have version suffixes, `go install` may run in
module-aware mode or `GOPATH` mode, depending on the `GO111MODULE` environment
variable and the presence of a `go.mod` file. See [Module-aware
commands](#mod-commands) for details. If module-aware mode is enabled, `go
install` runs in the context of the main module, which may be different from the
module containing the package being installed.

### `go list -m` {#go-list-m}

Usage:

```
go list -m [-u] [-retracted] [-versions] [list flags] [modules]
```

Example:

```
$ go list -m all
$ go list -m -versions example.com/m
$ go list -m -json example.com/m@latest
```

The `-m` flag causes `go list` to list modules instead of packages. In this
mode, the arguments to `go list` may be modules, module patterns (containing the
`...` wildcard), [version queries](#version-queries), or the special pattern
`all`, which matches all modules in the [build list](#glos-build-list). If no
arguments are specified, the [main module](#glos-main-module) is listed.

When listing modules, the `-f` flag still specifies a format template applied
to a Go struct, but now a `Module` struct:

```
type Module struct {
    Path       string       // module path
    Version    string       // module version
    Versions   []string     // available module versions (with -versions)
    Replace    *Module      // replaced by this module
    Time       *time.Time   // time version was created
    Update     *Module      // available update, if any (with -u)
    Main       bool         // is this the main module?
    Indirect   bool         // is this module only an indirect dependency of main module?
    Dir        string       // directory holding files for this module, if any
    GoMod      string       // path to go.mod file for this module, if any
    GoVersion  string       // go version used in module
    Deprecated string       // deprecation message, if any (with -u)
    Error      *ModuleError // error loading module
}

type ModuleError struct {
    Err string // the error itself
}
```

The default output is to print the module path and then information about the
version and replacement if any. For example, `go list -m all` might print:

```
example.com/main/module
golang.org/x/net v0.1.0
golang.org/x/text v0.3.0 => /tmp/text
rsc.io/pdf v0.1.1
```

The `Module` struct has a `String` method that formats this line of output, so
that the default format is equivalent to {{raw "`-f '{{.String}}'`"}}.

Note that when a module has been replaced, its `Replace` field describes the
replacement module module, and its `Dir` field is set to the replacement
module's source code, if present. (That is, if `Replace` is non-nil, then `Dir`
is set to `Replace.Dir`, with no access to the replaced source code.)

The `-u` flag adds information about available upgrades. When the latest version
of a given module is newer than the current one, `list -u` sets the module's
`Update` field to information about the newer module. `list -u` also prints
whether the currently selected version is [retracted](#glos-retracted-version)
and whether the module is [deprecated](#go-mod-file-module-deprecation). The
module's `String` method indicates an available upgrade by formatting the newer
version in brackets after the current version. For example, `go list -m -u all`
might print:

```
example.com/main/module
golang.org/x/old v1.9.9 (deprecated)
golang.org/x/net v0.1.0 (retracted) [v0.2.0]
golang.org/x/text v0.3.0 [v0.4.0] => /tmp/text
rsc.io/pdf v0.1.1 [v0.1.2]
```

(For tools, `go list -m -u -json all` may be more convenient to parse.)

The `-versions` flag causes `list` to set the module's `Versions` field to a
list of all known versions of that module, ordered according to semantic
versioning, lowest to highest. The flag also changes the default output format
to display the module path followed by the space-separated version list.
Retracted versions are omitted from this list unless the `-retracted` flag
is also specified.

The `-retracted` flag instructs `list` to show retracted versions in the list
printed with the `-versions` flag and to consider retracted versions when
resolving [version queries](#version-queries). For example, `go list -m
-retracted example.com/m@latest` shows the highest release or pre-release
version of the module `example.com/m`, even if that version is retracted.
[`retract` directives](#go-mod-file-retract) and
[deprecations](#go-mod-file-module-deprecation) are loaded from the `go.mod`
file at this version. The `-retracted` flag was added in Go 1.16.

The template function `module` takes a single string argument that must be a
module path or query and returns the specified module as a `Module` struct. If
an error occurs, the result will be a `Module` struct with a non-nil `Error`
field.

### `go mod download` {#go-mod-download}

Usage:

```
go mod download [-json] [-x] [modules]
```

Example:

```
$ go mod download
$ go mod download golang.org/x/mod@v0.2.0
```

The `go mod download` command downloads the named modules into the [module
cache](#glos-module-cache). Arguments can be module paths or module
patterns selecting dependencies of the main module or [version
queries](#version-queries) of the form `path@version`. With no arguments,
`download` applies to all dependencies of the [main module](#glos-main-module).

The `go` command will automatically download modules as needed during ordinary
execution. The `go mod download` command is useful mainly for pre-filling the
module cache or for loading data to be served by a [module
proxy](#glos-module-proxy).

By default, `download` writes nothing to standard output. It prints progress
messages and errors to standard error.

The `-json` flag causes `download` to print a sequence of JSON objects to
standard output, describing each downloaded module (or failure), corresponding
to this Go struct:

```
type Module struct {
    Path     string // module path
    Version  string // module version
    Error    string // error loading module
    Info     string // absolute path to cached .info file
    GoMod    string // absolute path to cached .mod file
    Zip      string // absolute path to cached .zip file
    Dir      string // absolute path to cached source root directory
    Sum      string // checksum for path, version (as in go.sum)
    GoModSum string // checksum for go.mod (as in go.sum)
}
```

The `-x` flag causes `download` to print the commands `download` executes
to standard error.

### `go mod edit` {#go-mod-edit}

Usage:

```
go mod edit [editing flags] [-fmt|-print|-json] [go.mod]
```

Example:

```
# Add a replace directive.
$ go mod edit -replace example.com/a@v1.0.0=./a

# Remove a replace directive.
$ go mod edit -dropreplace example.com/a@v1.0.0

# Set the go version, add a requirement, and print the file
# instead of writing it to disk.
$ go mod edit -go=1.14 -require=example.com/m@v1.0.0 -print

# Format the go.mod file.
$ go mod edit -fmt

# Format and print a different .mod file.
$ go mod edit -print tools.mod

# Print a JSON representation of the go.mod file.
$ go mod edit -json
```

The `go mod edit` command provides a command-line interface for editing and
formatting `go.mod` files, for use primarily by tools and scripts. `go mod edit`
reads only one `go.mod` file; it does not look up information about other
modules. By default, `go mod edit` reads and writes the `go.mod` file of the
main module, but a different target file can be specified after the editing
flags.

The editing flags specify a sequence of editing operations.

* The `-module` flag changes the module's path (the `go.mod` file's module
  line).
* The `-go=version` flag sets the expected Go language version.
* The `-require=path@version` and `-droprequire=path` flags add and drop a
  requirement on the given module path and version. Note that `-require`
  overrides any existing requirements on `path`. These flags are mainly for
  tools that understand the module graph. Users should prefer `go get
  path@version` or `go get path@none`, which make other `go.mod` adjustments as
  needed to satisfy constraints imposed by other modules. See [`go
  get`](#go-get).
* The `-exclude=path@version` and `-dropexclude=path@version` flags add and drop
  an exclusion for the given module path and version. Note that
  `-exclude=path@version` is a no-op if that exclusion already exists.
* The `-replace=old[@v]=new[@v]` flag adds a replacement of the given module
  path and version pair. If the `@v` in `old@v` is omitted, a replacement
  without a version on the left side is added, which applies to all versions of
  the old module path. If the `@v` in `new@v` is omitted, the new path should be
  a local module root directory, not a module path. Note that `-replace`
  overrides any redundant replacements for `old[@v]`, so omitting `@v` will drop
  replacements for specific versions.
* The `-dropreplace=old[@v]` flag drops a replacement of the given module path
  and version pair. If the `@v` is provided, a replacement with the given
  version is dropped. An existing replacement without a version on the left side
  may still replace the module. If the `@v` is omitted, a replacement without a
  version is dropped.
* The `-retract=version` and `-dropretract=version` flags add and drop a
  retraction for the given version, which may be a single version (like
  `v1.2.3`) or an interval (like `[v1.1.0,v1.2.0]`). Note that the `-retract`
  flag cannot add a rationale comment for the `retract` directive. Rationale
  comments are recommended and may be shown by `go list -m -u` and other
  commands.

The editing flags may be repeated. The changes are applied in the order given.

`go mod edit` has additional flags that control its output.

* The `-fmt` flag reformats the `go.mod` file without making other changes.
  This reformatting is also implied by any other modifications that use or
  rewrite the `go.mod` file. The only time this flag is needed is if no
  other flags are specified, as in `go mod edit -fmt`.
* The `-print` flag prints the final `go.mod` in its text format instead of
  writing it back to disk.
* The `-json` flag prints the final `go.mod` in JSON format instead of writing
  it back to disk in text format. The JSON output corresponds to these Go types:

```
type Module struct {
        Path    string
        Version string
}

type GoMod struct {
        Module  Module
        Go      string
        Require []Require
        Exclude []Module
        Replace []Replace
}

type Require struct {
        Path     string
        Version  string
        Indirect bool
}

type Replace struct {
        Old Module
        New Module
}

type Retract struct {
        Low       string
        High      string
        Rationale string
}

```

Note that this only describes the `go.mod` file itself, not other modules
referred to indirectly. For the full set of modules available to a build,
use `go list -m -json all`. See [`go list -m`](#go-list-m).

For example, a tool can obtain the `go.mod` file as a data structure by
parsing the output of `go mod edit -json` and can then make changes by invoking
`go mod edit` with `-require`, `-exclude`, and so on.

Tools may also use the package
[`golang.org/x/mod/modfile`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/modfile?tab=doc)
to parse, edit, and format `go.mod` files.

### `go mod graph` {#go-mod-graph}

Usage:

```
go mod graph [-go=version]
```

The `go mod graph` command prints the [module requirement
graph](#glos-module-graph) (with replacements applied) in text form. For
example:

```
example.com/main example.com/a@v1.1.0
example.com/main example.com/b@v1.2.0
example.com/a@v1.1.0 example.com/b@v1.1.1
example.com/a@v1.1.0 example.com/c@v1.3.0
example.com/b@v1.1.0 example.com/c@v1.1.0
example.com/b@v1.2.0 example.com/c@v1.2.0
```

Each vertex in the module graph represents a specific version of a module.
Each edge in the graph represents a requirement on a minimum version of a
dependency.

`go mod graph` prints the edges of the graph, one per line. Each line has two
space-separated fields: a module version and one of its dependencies. Each
module version is identified as a string of the form `path@version`. The main
module has no `@version` suffix, since it has no version.

The `-go` flag causes `go mod graph` to report the module graph as
loaded by the given Go version, instead of the version indicated by
the [`go` directive](#go-mod-file-go) in the `go.mod` file.

See [Minimal version selection (MVS)](#minimal-version-selection) for more
information on how versions are chosen. See also [`go list -m`](#go-list-m) for
printing selected versions and [`go mod why`](#go-mod-why) for understanding
why a module is needed.

### `go mod init` {#go-mod-init}

Usage:

```
go mod init [module-path]
```

Example:

```
go mod init
go mod init example.com/m
```

The `go mod init` command initializes and writes a new `go.mod` file in the
current directory, in effect creating a new module rooted at the current
directory. The `go.mod` file must not already exist.

`init` accepts one optional argument, the [module path](#glos-module-path) for
the new module. See [Module paths](#module-path) for instructions on choosing
a module path. If the module path argument is omitted, `init` will attempt
to infer the module path using import comments in `.go` files, vendoring tool
configuration files, and the current directory (if in `GOPATH`).

If a configuration file for a vendoring tool is present, `init` will attempt to
import module requirements from it. `init` supports the following configuration
files.

* `GLOCKFILE` (Glock)
* `Godeps/Godeps.json` (Godeps)
* `Gopkg.lock` (dep)
* `dependencies.tsv` (godeps)
* `glide.lock` (glide)
* `vendor.conf` (trash)
* `vendor.yml` (govend)
* `vendor/manifest` (gvt)
* `vendor/vendor.json` (govendor)

Vendoring tool configuration files can't always be translated with perfect
fidelity. For example, if multiple packages within the same repository are
imported at different versions, and the repository only contains one module, the
imported `go.mod` can only require the module at one version. You may wish to
run [`go list -m all`](#go-list-m) to check all versions in the [build
list](#glos-build-list), and [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) to add missing
requirements and to drop unused requirements.

### `go mod tidy` {#go-mod-tidy}

Usage:

```
go mod tidy [-e] [-v] [-go=version] [-compat=version]
```

`go mod tidy` ensures that the `go.mod` file matches the source code in the
module. It adds any missing module requirements necessary to build the current
module's packages and dependencies, and it removes requirements on modules that
don't provide any relevant packages. It also adds any missing entries to
`go.sum` and removes unnecessary entries.

The `-e` flag (added in Go 1.16) causes `go mod tidy` to attempt to proceed
despite errors encountered while loading packages.

The `-v` flag causes `go mod tidy` to print information about removed modules
to standard error.

`go mod tidy` works by loading all of the packages in the [main
module](#glos-main-module) and all of the packages they import,
recursively. This includes packages imported by tests (including tests in other
modules). `go mod tidy` acts as if all build tags are enabled, so it will
consider platform-specific source files and files that require custom build
tags, even if those source files wouldn't normally be built. There is one
exception: the `ignore` build tag is not enabled, so a file with the build
constraint `// +build ignore` will not be considered. Note that `go mod tidy`
will not consider packages in the main module in directories named `testdata` or
with names that start with `.` or `_` unless those packages are explicitly
imported by other packages.

Once `go mod tidy` has loaded this set of packages, it ensures that each module
that provides one or more packages has a `require` directive in the main
module's `go.mod` file or — if the main module is at `go 1.16` or below — is
required by another required module. `go mod tidy` will add a requirement on the
latest version of each missing module (see [Version queries](#version-queries)
for the definition of the `latest` version). `go mod tidy` will remove `require`
directives for modules that don't provide any packages in the set described
above.

`go mod tidy` may also add or remove `// indirect` comments on `require`
directives. An `// indirect` comment denotes a module that does not provide a
package imported by a package in the main module. (See the [`require`
directive](#go-mod-file-require) for more detail on when `// indirect`
dependencies and comments are added.)

If the `-go` flag is set, `go mod tidy` will update the [`go`
directive](#go-mod-file-go) to the indicated version, enabling or disabling
[module graph pruning](#graph-pruning) and [lazy module loading](#lazy-loading)
(and adding or removing indirect requirements as needed) according to that
version.

By default, `go mod tidy` will check that the [selected
versions](#glos-selected-version) of modules do not change when the module graph
is loaded by the Go version immediately preceding the version indicated in the
`go` directive. The versioned checked for compatibility can also be specified
explicitly via the `-compat` flag.

### `go mod vendor` {#go-mod-vendor}

Usage:

```
go mod vendor [-e] [-v]
```

The `go mod vendor` command constructs a directory named `vendor` in the [main
module's](#glos-main-module) root directory that contains copies of all packages
needed to support builds and tests of packages in the main module. Packages
that are only imported by tests of packages outside the main module are not
included. As with [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) and other module commands,
[build constraints](#glos-build-constraint) except for `ignore` are not
considered when constructing the `vendor` directory.

When vendoring is enabled, the `go` command will load packages from the `vendor`
directory instead of downloading modules from their sources into the module
cache and using packages those downloaded copies. See [Vendoring](#vendoring)
for more information.

`go mod vendor` also creates the file `vendor/modules.txt` that contains a list
of vendored packages and the module versions they were copied from. When
vendoring is enabled, this manifest is used as a source of module version
information, as reported by [`go list -m`](#go-list-m) and [`go version
-m`](#go-version-m). When the `go` command reads `vendor/modules.txt`, it checks
that the module versions are consistent with `go.mod`. If `go.mod` changed since
`vendor/modules.txt` was generated, `go mod vendor` should be run again.

Note that `go mod vendor` removes the `vendor` directory if it exists before
re-constructing it. Local changes should not be made to vendored packages.
The `go` command does not check that packages in the `vendor` directory have
not been modified, but one can verify the integrity of the `vendor` directory
by running `go mod vendor` and checking that no changes were made.

The `-e` flag (added in Go 1.16) causes `go mod vendor` to attempt to proceed
despite errors encountered while loading packages.

The `-v` flag causes `go mod vendor` to print the names of vendored modules
and packages to standard error.

### `go mod verify` {#go-mod-verify}

Usage:

```
go mod verify
```

`go mod verify` checks that dependencies of the [main module](#glos-main-module)
stored in the [module cache](#glos-module-cache) have not been modified since
they were downloaded. To perform this check, `go mod verify` hashes each
downloaded module [`.zip` file](#zip-files) and extracted directory, then
compares those hashes with a hash recorded when the module was first
downloaded. `go mod verify` checks each module in the [build
list](#glos-build-list) (which may be printed with [`go list -m
all`](#go-list-m)).

If all the modules are unmodified, `go mod verify` prints "all modules
verified". Otherwise, it reports which modules have been changed and exits with
a non-zero status.

Note that all module-aware commands verify that hashes in the main module's
`go.sum` file match hashes recorded for modules downloaded into the module
cache. If a hash is missing from `go.sum` (for example, because the module is
being used for the first time), the `go` command verifies its hash using the
[checksum database](#checksum-database) (unless the module path is matched by
`GOPRIVATE` or `GONOSUMDB`). See [Authenticating modules](#authenticating) for
details.

In contrast, `go mod verify` checks that module `.zip` files and their extracted
directories have hashes that match hashes recorded in the module cache when they
were first downloaded. This is useful for detecting changes to files in the
module cache *after* a module has been downloaded and verified. `go mod verify`
does not download content for modules not in the cache, and it does not use
`go.sum` files to verify module content. However, `go mod verify` may download
`go.mod` files in order to perform [minimal version
selection](#minimal-version-selection). It will use `go.sum` to verify those
files, and it may add `go.sum` entries for missing hashes.

### `go mod why` {#go-mod-why}

Usage:

```
go mod why [-m] [-vendor] packages...
```

`go mod why` shows a shortest path in the import graph from the main module to
each of the listed packages.

The output is a sequence of stanzas, one for each package or module named on the
command line, separated by blank lines. Each stanza begins with a comment line
starting with `#` giving the target package or module. Subsequent lines give a
path through the import graph, one package per line. If the package or module
is not referenced from the main module, the stanza will display a single
parenthesized note indicating that fact.

For example:

```
$ go mod why golang.org/x/text/language golang.org/x/text/encoding
# golang.org/x/text/language
rsc.io/quote
rsc.io/sampler
golang.org/x/text/language

# golang.org/x/text/encoding
(main module does not need package golang.org/x/text/encoding)
```

The `-m` flag causes `go mod why` to treat its arguments as a list of modules.
`go mod why` will print a path to any package in each of the modules. Note that
even when `-m` is used, `go mod why` queries the package graph, not the
module graph printed by [`go mod graph`](#go-mod-graph).

The `-vendor` flag causes `go mod why` to ignore imports in tests of packages
outside the main module (as [`go mod vendor`](#go-mod-vendor) does). By default,
`go mod why` considers the graph of packages matched by the `all` pattern. This
flag has no effect after Go 1.16 in modules that declare `go 1.16` or higher
(using the [`go` directive](#go-mod-file-go) in `go.mod`), since the meaning of
`all` changed to match the set of packages matched by `go mod vendor`.

### `go version -m` {#go-version-m}

Usage:

```
go version [-m] [-v] [file ...]
```

Example:

```
# Print Go version used to build go.
$ go version

# Print Go version used to build a specific executable.
$ go version ~/go/bin/gopls

# Print Go version and module versions used to build a specific executable.
$ go version -m ~/go/bin/gopls

# Print Go version and module versions used to build executables in a directory.
$ go version -m ~/go/bin/
```

`go version` reports the Go version used to build each executable file named
on the command line.

If no files are named on the command line, `go version` prints its own version
information.

If a directory is named, `go version` walks that directory, recursively, looking
for recognized Go binaries and reporting their versions. By default, `go
version` does not report unrecognized files found during a directory scan. The
`-v` flag causes it to report unrecognized files.

The `-m` flag causes `go version` to print each executable's embedded module
version information, when available. For each executable, `go version -m` prints
a table with tab-separated columns like the one below.

```
$ go version -m ~/go/bin/goimports
/home/jrgopher/go/bin/goimports: go1.14.3
        path    golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
        mod     golang.org/x/tools      v0.0.0-20200518203908-8018eb2c26ba      h1:0Lcy64USfQQL6GAJma8BdHCgeofcchQj+Z7j0SXYAzU=
        dep     golang.org/x/mod        v0.2.0          h1:KU7oHjnv3XNWfa5COkzUifxZmxp1TyI7ImMXqFxLwvQ=
        dep     golang.org/x/xerrors    v0.0.0-20191204190536-9bdfabe68543      h1:E7g+9GITq07hpfrRu66IVDexMakfv52eLZ2CXBWiKr4=
```

The format of the table may change in the future. The same information may be
obtained from
[`runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug?tab=doc#ReadBuildInfo).

The meaning of each row in the table is determined by the word in the first
column.

* **`path`**: the path of the `main` package used to build the executable.
* **`mod`**: the module containing the `main` package. The columns are the
  module path, version, and sum, respectively. The [main
  module](#glos-main-module) has the version `(devel)` and no sum.
* **`dep`**: a module that provided one or more packages linked into the
  executable. Same format as `mod`.
* **`=>`**: a [replacement](#go-mod-file-replace) for the module on the previous
  line. If the replacement is a local directory, only the directory path is
  listed (no version or sum). If the replacement is a module version, the path,
  version, and sum are listed, as with `mod` and `dep`. A replaced module has
  no sum.

### `go clean -modcache` {#go-clean-modcache}

Usage:

```
go clean [-modcache]
```

The `-modcache` flag causes [`go
clean`](/cmd/go/#hdr-Remove_object_files_and_cached_files) to remove the entire
[module cache](#glos-module-cache), including unpacked source code of versioned
dependencies.

This is usually the best way to remove the module cache. By default, most files
and directories in the module cache are read-only to prevent tests and editors
from unintentionally changing files after they've been
[authenticated](#authenticating). Unfortunately, this causes commands like
`rm -r` to fail, since files can't be removed without first making their parent
directories writable.

The `-modcacherw` flag (accepted by [`go
build`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies) and
other module-aware commands) causes new directories in the module cache to
be writable. To pass `-modcacherw` to all module-aware commands, add it to the
`GOFLAGS` variable. `GOFLAGS` may be set in the environment or with [`go env
-w`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Print_Go_environment_information). For
example, the command below sets it permanently:

```
go env -w GOFLAGS=-modcacherw
```

`-modcacherw` should be used with caution; developers should be careful not
to make changes to files in the module cache. [`go mod verify`](#go-mod-verify)
may be used to check that files in the cache match hashes in the main module's
`go.sum` file.

### Version queries {#version-queries}

Several commands allow you to specify a version of a module using a *version
query*, which appears after an `@` character following a module or package path
on the command line.

Examples:

```
go get example.com/m@latest
go mod download example.com/m@master
go list -m -json example.com/m@e3702bed2
```

A version query may be one of the following:

* A fully-specified semantic version, such as `v1.2.3`, which selects a
  specific version. See [Versions](#versions) for syntax.
* A semantic version prefix, such as `v1` or `v1.2`, which selects the highest
  available version with that prefix.
* A semantic version comparison, such as {{raw "`<v1.2.3` or `>=v1.5.6`"}}, which selects
  the nearest available version to the comparison target (the lowest version
  for `>` and `>=`, and the highest version for {{raw "`<` and `<=`"}}).
* A revision identifier for the underlying source repository, such as a commit
  hash prefix, revision tag, or branch name. If the revision is tagged with a
  semantic version, this query selects that version. Otherwise, this query
  selects a [pseudo-version](#glos-pseudo-version) for the underlying
  commit. Note that branches and tags with names matched by other version
  queries cannot be selected this way. For example, the query `v2` selects the
  latest version starting with `v2`, not the branch named `v2`.
* The string `latest`, which selects the highest available release version. If
  there are no release versions, `latest` selects the highest pre-release
  version.  If there no tagged versions, `latest` selects a pseudo-version for
  the commit at the tip of the repository's default branch.
* The string `upgrade`, which is like `latest` except that if the module is
  currently required at a higher version than the version `latest` would select
  (for example, a pre-release), `upgrade` will select the current version.
* The string `patch`, which selects the latest available version with the same
  major and minor version numbers as the currently required version. If no
  version is currently required, `patch` is equivalent to `latest`. Since
  Go 1.16, [`go get`](#go-get) requires a current version when using `patch`
  (but the `-u=patch` flag does not have this requirement).

Except for queries for specific named versions or revisions, all queries
consider available versions reported by `go list -m -versions` (see [`go list
-m`](#go-list-m)). This list contains only tagged versions, not pseudo-versions.
Module versions disallowed by [`exclude` directives](#go-mod-file-exclude) in
the main module's [`go.mod` file](#glos-go-mod-file) are not considered.
Versions covered by [`retract` directives](#go-mod-file-retract) in the `go.mod`
file from the `latest` version of the same module are also ignored except when
the `-retracted` flag is used with [`go list -m`](#go-list-m) and except when
loading `retract` directives.

[Release versions](#glos-release-version) are preferred over pre-release
versions. For example, if versions `v1.2.2` and `v1.2.3-pre` are available, the
`latest` query will select `v1.2.2`, even though `v1.2.3-pre` is higher. The
{{raw "`<v1.2.4`"}} query would also select `v1.2.2`, even though `v1.2.3-pre` is closer
to `v1.2.4`. If no release or pre-release version is available, the `latest`,
`upgrade`, and `patch` queries will select a pseudo-version for the commit
at the tip of the repository's default branch. Other queries will report
an error.

### Module commands outside a module {#commands-outside}

Module-aware Go commands normally run in the context of a [main
module](#glos-main-module) defined by a `go.mod` file in the working directory
or a parent directory. Some commands may be run in module-aware mode without a
`go.mod` file, but most commands work differently or report an error when no
`go.mod` file is present.

See [Module-aware commands](#mod-commands) for information on enabling and
disabling module-aware mode.

## Module proxies {#module-proxy}

### `GOPROXY` protocol {#goproxy-protocol}

A <dfn>module proxy</dfn> is an HTTP server that can respond to `GET` requests
for paths specified below. The requests have no query parameters, and no
specific headers are required, so even a site serving from a fixed file system
(including a `file://` URL) can be a module proxy.

Successful HTTP responses must have the status code 200 (OK). Redirects (3xx)
are followed. Responses with status codes 4xx and 5xx are treated as errors.
The error codes 404 (Not Found) and 410 (Gone) indicate that the
requested module or version is not available on the proxy, but it may be found
elsewhere. Error responses should have content type `text/plain` with
`charset` either `utf-8` or `us-ascii`.

The `go` command may be configured to contact proxies or source control servers
using the `GOPROXY` environment variable, which accepts a list of proxy URLs.
The list may include the keywords `direct` or `off` (see [Environment
variables](#environment-variables) for details). List elements may be separated
by commas (`,`) or pipes (`|`), which determine error fallback behavior. When a
URL is followed by a comma, the `go` command falls back to later sources only
after a 404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone) response. When a URL is followed by a
pipe, the `go` command falls back to later sources after any error, including
non-HTTP errors such as timeouts. This error handling behavior lets a proxy act
as a gatekeeper for unknown modules. For example, a proxy could respond with
error 403 (Forbidden) for modules not on an approved list (see [Private proxy
serving private modules](#private-module-proxy-private)).

The table below specifies queries that a module proxy must respond to. For each
path, `$base` is the path portion of a proxy URL,`$module` is a module path, and
`$version` is a version. For example, if the proxy URL is
`https://example.com/mod`, and the client is requesting the `go.mod` file for
the module `golang.org/x/text` at version `v0.3.2`, the client would send a
`GET` request for `https://example.com/mod/golang.org/x/text/@v/v0.3.2.mod`.

To avoid ambiguity when serving from case-insensitive file systems,
the `$module` and `$version` elements are case-encoded by replacing every
uppercase letter with an exclamation mark followed by the corresponding
lower-case letter. This allows modules `example.com/M` and `example.com/m` to
both be stored on disk, since the former is encoded as `example.com/!m`.

When resolving the latest version of a module, the `go` command will request
`$base/$module/@v/list`, then, if no suitable versions are found,
`$base/$module/@latest`. The `go` command prefers, in order: the semantically
highest release version, the semantically highest pre-release version, and the
chronologically most recent pseudo-version. In Go 1.12 and earlier, the `go`
command considered pseudo-versions in `$base/$module/@v/list` to be pre-release
versions, but this is no longer true since Go 1.13.

A module proxy must always serve the same content for successful
responses for `$base/$module/$version.mod` and `$base/$module/$version.zip`
queries. This content is [cryptographically authenticated](#authenticating)
using [`go.sum` files](go-sum-files) and, by default, the
[checksum database](#checksum-database).

The `go` command caches most content it downloads from module proxies in its
module cache in `$GOPATH/pkg/mod/cache/download`. Even when downloading directly
from version control systems, the `go` command synthesizes explicit `info`,
`mod`, and `zip` files and stores them in this directory, the same as if it had
downloaded them directly from a proxy. The cache layout is the same as the proxy
URL space, so serving `$GOPATH/pkg/mod/cache/download` at (or copying it to)
`https://example.com/proxy` would let users access cached module versions by
setting `GOPROXY` to `https://example.com/proxy`.

### Communicating with proxies {#communicating-with-proxies}

The `go` command may download module source code and metadata from a [module
proxy](#glos-module-proxy). The `GOPROXY` [environment
variable](#environment-variables) may be used to configure which proxies the
`go` command may connect to and whether it may communicate directly with
[version control systems](#vcs). Downloaded module data is saved in the [module
cache](#glos-module-cache). The `go` command will only contact a proxy when it
needs information not already in the cache.

The [`GOPROXY` protocol](#goproxy-protocol) section describes requests that
may be sent to a `GOPROXY` server. However, it's also helpful to understand
when the `go` command makes these requests. For example, `go build` follows
the procedure below:

* Compute the [build list](#glos-build-list) by reading [`go.mod`
  files](#glos-go-mod-file) and performing [minimal version selection
  (MVS)](#glos-minimal-version-selection).
* Read the packages named on the command line and the packages they import.
* If a package is not provided by any module in the build list, find a module
  that provides it. Add a module requirement on its latest version to `go.mod`,
  and start over.
* Build packages after everything is loaded.

When the `go` command computes the build list, it loads the `go.mod` file for
each module in the [module graph](#glos-module-graph). If a `go.mod` file is not
in the cache, the `go` command will download it from the proxy using a
`$module/@v/$version.mod` request (where `$module` is the module path and
`$version` is the version). These requests can be tested with a tool like
`curl`. For example, the command below downloads the `go.mod` file for
`golang.org/x/mod` at version `v0.2.0`:

```
$ curl https://proxy.golang.org/golang.org/x/mod/@v/v0.2.0.mod
module golang.org/x/mod

go 1.12

require (
	golang.org/x/crypto v0.0.0-20191011191535-87dc89f01550
	golang.org/x/tools v0.0.0-20191119224855-298f0cb1881e
	golang.org/x/xerrors v0.0.0-20191011141410-1b5146add898
)
```

In order to load a package, the `go` command needs the source code for the
module that provides it. Module source code is distributed in `.zip` files which
are extracted into the module cache. If a module `.zip` is not in the cache,
the `go` command will download it using a `$module/@v/$version.zip` request.

```
$ curl -O https://proxy.golang.org/golang.org/x/mod/@v/v0.2.0.zip
$ unzip -l v0.2.0.zip | head
Archive:  v0.2.0.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name

```

Note that `.mod` and `.zip` requests are separate, even though `go.mod` files
are usually contained within `.zip` files. The `go` command may need to download
`go.mod` files for many different modules, and `.mod` files are much smaller
than `.zip` files. Additionally, if a Go project does not have a `go.mod` file,
the proxy will serve a synthetic `go.mod` file that only contains a [`module`
directive](#go-mod-file-module). Synthetic `go.mod` files are generated by the
`go` command when downloading from a [version control system](#vcs).

If the `go` command needs to load a package not provided by any module in the
build list, it will attempt to find a new module that provides it. The section
[Resolving a package to a module](#resolve-pkg-mod) describes this process. In
summary, the `go` command requests information about the latest version of each
module path that could possibly contain the package. For example, for the
package `golang.org/x/net/html`, the `go` command would try to find the latest
versions of the modules `golang.org/x/net/html`, `golang.org/x/net`,
`golang.org/x/`, and `golang.org`. Only `golang.org/x/net` actually exists and
provides that package, so the `go` command uses the latest version of that
module. If more than one module provides the package, the `go` command will use
the module with the longest path.

When the `go` command requests the latest version of a module, it first sends a
request for `$module/@v/list`. If the list is empty or none of the returned
versions can be used, it sends a request for `$module/@latest`. Once a version
is chosen, the `go` command sends a `$module/@v/$version.info` request for
metadata. It may then send `$module/@v/$version.mod` and
`$module/@v/$version.zip` requests to load the `go.mod` file and source code.

```
$ curl https://proxy.golang.org/golang.org/x/mod/@v/list
v0.1.0
v0.2.0

$ curl https://proxy.golang.org/golang.org/x/mod/@v/v0.2.0.info
{"Version":"v0.2.0","Time":"2020-01-02T17:33:45Z"}
```

After downloading a `.mod` or `.zip` file, the `go` command computes a
cryptographic hash and checks that it matches a hash in the main module's
`go.sum` file. If the hash is not present in `go.sum`, by default, the `go`
command retrieves it from the [checksum database](#checksum-database). If the
computed hash does not match, the `go` command reports a security error and does
not install the file in the module cache. The `GOPRIVATE` and `GONOSUMDB`
[environment variables](#environment-variables) may be used to disable requests
to the checksum database for specific modules. The `GOSUMDB` environment
variable may also be set to `off` to disable requests to the checksum database
entirely. See [Authenticating modules](#authenticating) for more
information. Note that version lists and version metadata returned for `.info`
requests are not authenticated and may change over time.

### Serving modules directly from a proxy {#serving-from-proxy}

Most modules are developed and served from a version control repository. In
[direct mode](#glos-direct-mode), the `go` command downloads such a module with
a version control tool (see [Version control systems](#vcs)). It's also possible
to serve a module directly from a module proxy. This is useful for organizations
that want to serve modules without exposing their version control servers and
for organizations that use version control tools the `go` command does not
support.

When the `go` command downloads a module in direct mode, it first looks up the
module server's URL with an HTTP GET request based on the module path. It looks
for a `<meta>` tag with the name `go-import` in the HTML response. The tag's
content must contain the [repository root
path](#glos-repository-root-path), the version control system, and the URL,
separated by spaces. See [Finding a repository for a module path](#vcs-find) for
details.

If the version control system is `mod`, the `go` command downloads the module
from the given URL using the [`GOPROXY` protocol](#goproxy-protocol).

For example, suppose the `go` command is attempting to download the module
`example.com/gopher` at version `v1.0.0`. It sends a request to
`https://example.com/gopher?go-get=1`. The server responds with an HTML document
containing the tag:

```
<meta name="go-import" content="example.com/gopher mod https://modproxy.example.com">
```

Based on this response, the `go` command downloads the module by sending
requests for `https://modproxy.example.com/example.com/gopher/@v/v1.0.0.info`,
`v1.0.0.mod`, and `v1.0.0.zip`.

Note that modules served directly from a proxy cannot be downloaded with
`go get` in GOPATH mode.

## Version control systems {#vcs}

The `go` command may download module source code and metadata directly from a
version control repository. Downloading a module from a
[proxy](#communicating-with-proxies) is usually faster, but connecting directly
to a repository is necessary if a proxy is not available or if a module's
repository is not accessible to a proxy (frequently true for private
repositories). Git, Subversion, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Fossil are supported. A
version control tool must be installed in a directory in `PATH` in order for the
`go` command to use it.

To download specific modules from source repositories instead of a proxy, set
the `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOPROXY` environment variables. To configure the `go`
command to download all modules directly from source repositories, set `GOPROXY`
to `direct`. See [Environment variables](#environment-variables) for more
information.

### Finding a repository for a module path {#vcs-find}

When the `go` command downloads a module in `direct` mode, it starts by locating
the repository that contains the module.

If the module path has a VCS qualifier (one of `.bzr`, `.fossil`, `.git`, `.hg`,
`.svn`) at the end of a path component, the `go` command will use everything up
to that path qualifier as the repository URL. For example, for the module
`example.com/foo.git/bar`, the `go` command downloads the repository at
`example.com/foo.git` using git, expecting to find the module in the `bar`
subdirectory. The `go` command will guess the protocol to use based on the
protocols supported by the version control tool.

If the module path does not have a qualifier, the `go` command sends an HTTP
`GET` request to a URL derived from the module path with a `?go-get=1` query
string. For example, for the module `golang.org/x/mod`, the `go` command may
send the following requests:

```
https://golang.org/x/mod?go-get=1 (preferred)
http://golang.org/x/mod?go-get=1  (fallback, only with GOINSECURE)
```

The `go` command follows redirects but otherwise ignores response status
codes, so the server may respond with a 404 or any other error status. The
`GOINSECURE` environment variable may be set to allow fallback and redirects to
unencrypted HTTP for specific modules.

The server must respond with an HTML document containing a `<meta>` tag in the
document's `<head>`. The `<meta>` tag should appear early in the document to
avoid confusing the `go` command's restricted parser. In particular, it should
appear before any raw JavaScript or CSS. The `<meta>` tag must have the form:

```
<meta name="go-import" content="root-path vcs repo-url">
```

`root-path` is the repository root path, the portion of the module path that
corresponds to the repository's root directory. It must be a prefix or an exact
match of the requested module path. If it's not an exact match, another request
is made for the prefix to verify the `<meta>` tags match.

`vcs` is the version control system. It must be one of the tools listed in the
table below or the keyword `mod`, which instructs the `go` command to download
the module from the given URL using the [`GOPROXY`
protocol](#goproxy-protocol). See [Serving modules directly from a
proxy](#serving-from-proxy) for details.

`repo-url` is the repository's URL. If the URL does not include a scheme (either
because the module path has a VCS qualifier or because the `<meta>` tag lacks a
scheme), the `go` command will try each protocol supported by the version
control system. For example, with Git, the `go` command will try `https://` then
`git+ssh://`. Insecure protocols (like `http://` and `git://`) may only be used
if the module path is matched by the `GOINSECURE` environment variable.

</table>

As an example, consider `golang.org/x/mod` again. The `go` command sends
a request to `https://golang.org/x/mod?go-get=1`. The server responds
with an HTML document containing the tag:

```
<meta name="go-import" content="golang.org/x/mod git https://go.googlesource.com/mod">
```

From this response, the `go` command will use the Git repository at
the remote URL `https://go.googlesource.com/mod`.

GitHub and other popular hosting services respond to `?go-get=1` queries for
all repositories, so usually no server configuration is necessary for modules
hosted at those sites.

After the repository URL is found, the `go` command will clone the repository
into the module cache. In general, the `go` command tries to avoid fetching
unneeded data from a repository. However, the actual commands used vary by
version control system and may change over time. For Git, the `go` command can
list most available versions without downloading commits. It will usually fetch
commits without downloading ancestor commits, but doing so is sometimes
necessary.

### Mapping versions to commits {#vcs-version}

The `go` command may check out a module within a repository at a specific
[canonical version](#glos-canonical-version) like `v1.2.3`, `v2.4.0-beta`, or
`v3.0.0+incompatible`. Each module version should have a <dfn>semantic version
tag</dfn> within the repository that indicates which revision should be checked
out for a given version.

If a module is defined in the repository root directory or in a major version
subdirectory of the root directory, then each version tag name is equal to the
corresponding version. For example, the module `golang.org/x/text` is defined in
the root directory of its repository, so the version `v0.3.2` has the tag
`v0.3.2` in that repository. This is true for most modules.

If a module is defined in a subdirectory within the repository, that is, the
[module subdirectory](#glos-module-subdirectory) portion of the module path is
not empty, then each tag name must be prefixed with the module subdirectory,
followed by a slash. For example, the module `golang.org/x/tools/gopls` is
defined in the `gopls` subdirectory of the repository with root path
`golang.org/x/tools`. The version `v0.4.0` of that module must have the tag
named `gopls/v0.4.0` in that repository.

The major version number of a semantic version tag must be consistent with the
module path's major version suffix (if any). For example, the tag `v1.0.0` could
belong to the module `example.com/mod` but not `example.com/mod/v2`, which would
have tags like `v2.0.0`.

A tag with major version `v2` or higher may belong to a module without a major
version suffix if no `go.mod` file is present, and the module is in the
repository root directory. This kind of version is denoted with the suffix
`+incompatible`. The version tag itself must not have the suffix. See
[Compatibility with non-module repositories](#non-module-compat).

Once a tag is created, it should not be deleted or changed to a different
revision. Versions are [authenticated](#authenticating) to ensure safe,
repeatable builds. If a tag is modified, clients may see a security error when
downloading it. Even after a tag is deleted, its content may remain
available on [module proxies](#glos-module-proxy).

### Mapping pseudo-versions to commits {#vcs-pseudo}

The `go` command may check out a module within a repository at a specific
revision, encoded as a [pseudo-version](#glos-pseudo-version) like
`v1.3.2-0.20191109021931-daa7c04131f5`.

The last 12 characters of the pseudo-version (`daa7c04131f5` in the example
above) indicate a revision in the repository to check out. The meaning of this
depends on the version control system. For Git and Mercurial, this is a prefix
of a commit hash. For Subversion, this is a zero-padded revision number.

Before checking out a commit, the `go` command verifies that the timestamp
(`20191109021931` above) matches the commit date. It also verifies that the base
version (`v1.3.1`, the version before `v1.3.2` in the example above) corresponds
to a semantic version tag that is an ancestor of the commit. These checks ensure
that module authors have full control over how pseudo-versions compare with
other released versions.

See [Pseudo-versions](#pseudo-versions) for more information.

### Mapping branches and commits to versions {#vcs-branch}

A module may be checked out at a specific branch, tag, or revision using a
[version query](#version-queries).

```
go get example.com/mod@master
```

The `go` command converts these names into [canonical
versions](#glos-canonical-version) that can be used with [minimal version
selection (MVS)](#minimal-version-selection). MVS depends on the ability to
order versions unambiguously. Branch names and revisions can't be compared
reliably over time, since they depend on repository structure which may change.

If a revision is tagged with one or more semantic version tags like `v1.2.3`,
the tag for the highest valid version will be used. The `go` command only
considers semantic version tags that could belong to the target module; for
example, the tag `v1.5.2` would not be considered for `example.com/mod/v2` since
the major version doesn't match the module path's suffix.

If a revision is not tagged with a valid semantic version tag, the `go` command
will generate a [pseudo-version](#glos-pseudo-version). If the revision has
ancestors with valid semantic version tags, the highest ancestor version will be
used as the pseudo-version base. See [Pseudo-versions](#pseudo-versions).

### Module directories within a repository {#vcs-dir}

Once a module's repository has been checked out at a specific revision, the `go`
command must locate the directory that contains the module's `go.mod` file
(the module's root directory).

Recall that a [module path](#module-path) consists of three parts: a
repository root path (corresponding to the repository root directory),
a module subdirectory, and a major version suffix (only for modules released at
`v2` or higher).

For most modules, the module path is equal to the repository root path, so
the module's root directory is the repository's root directory.

Modules are sometimes defined in repository subdirectories. This is typically
done for large repositories with multiple components that need to be released
and versioned independently. Such a module is expected to be found in a
subdirectory that matches the part of the module's path after the repository
root path.  For example, suppose the module `example.com/monorepo/foo/bar` is in
the repository with root path `example.com/monorepo`. Its `go.mod` file must be
in the `foo/bar` subdirectory.

If a module is released at major version `v2` or higher, its path must have a
[major version suffix](#major-version-suffixes). A module with a major version
suffix may be defined in one of two subdirectories: one with the suffix,
and one without. For example, suppose a new version of the module above is
released with the path `example.com/monorepo/foo/bar/v2`. Its `go.mod` file
may be in either `foo/bar` or `foo/bar/v2`.

Subdirectories with a major version suffix are <dfn>major version
subdirectories</dfn>. They may be used to develop multiple major versions of a
module on a single branch. This may be unnecessary when development of multiple
major versions proceeds on separate branches. However, major version
subdirectories have an important property: in `GOPATH` mode, package import
paths exactly match directories under `GOPATH/src`. The `go` command provides
minimal module compatibility in `GOPATH` mode (see [Compatibility with
non-module repositories](#non-module-compat)), so major version
subdirectories aren't always necessary for compatibility with projects built in
`GOPATH` mode. Older tools that don't support minimal module compatibility
may have problems though.

Once the `go` command has found the module root directory, it creates a `.zip`
file of the contents of the directory, then extracts the `.zip` file into the
module cache. See [File path and size constraints](#zip-path-size-constraints)
for details on what files may be included in the `.zip` file. The contents of
the `.zip` file are [authenticated](#authenticating) before extraction into the
module cache the same way they would be if the `.zip` file were downloaded from
a proxy.

Module zip files do not include the contents of `vendor` directories or any
nested modules (subdirectories that contain `go.mod` files). This means a module
must take care not to refer to files outside its directory or in other modules.
For example, [`//go:embed`](https://pkg.go.dev/embed#hdr-Directives) patterns
must not match files in nested modules. This behavior may serve as a useful
workaround in situations where files should not be included in a module.
For example, if a repository has large files checked into a `testdata`
directory, the module author could add an empty `go.mod` file in `testdata`
so their users don't need to download those files. Of course, this may reduce
coverage for users testing their dependencies.

### Special case for LICENSE files {#vcs-license}

When the `go` command creates a `.zip` file for a module that is not in the
repository root directory, if the module does not have a file named `LICENSE`
in its root directory (alongside `go.mod`), the `go` command will copy the
file named `LICENSE` from the repository root directory if it is present in
the same revision.

This special case allows the same `LICENSE` file to apply to all modules within
a repository. This only applies to files named `LICENSE` specifically, without
extensions like `.txt`. Unfortunately, this cannot be extended without breaking
cryptographic sums of existing modules; see [Authenticating
modules](#authenticating). Other tools and websites like
[pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev) may recognize files with other names.

Note also that the `go` command does not include symbolic links when creating
module `.zip` files; see [File path and size
constraints](#zip-path-size-constraints). Consequently, if a repository does not
have a `LICENSE` file in its root directory, authors may instead create copies
of their license files in modules defined in subdirectories to ensure those
files are included in module `.zip` files.

### Controlling version control tools with `GOVCS` {#vcs-govcs}

The `go` command's ability to download modules with version control commands
like `git` is critical to the decentralized package ecosystem, in which
code can be imported from any server. It is also a potential security problem
if a malicious server finds a way to cause the invoked version control command
to run unintended code.

To balance the functionality and security concerns, the `go` command by default
will only use `git` and `hg` to download code from public servers. It will use
any [known version control system](#vcs-support) to download code from private
servers, defined as those hosting packages matching the `GOPRIVATE` [environment
variable](#environment-variables). The rationale behind allowing only Git and
Mercurial is that these two systems have had the most attention to issues of
being run as clients of untrusted servers. In contrast, Bazaar, Fossil, and
Subversion have primarily been used in trusted, authenticated environments and
are not as well scrutinized as attack surfaces.

The version control command restrictions only apply when using direct version
control access to download code. When downloading modules from a proxy, the `go`
command uses the [`GOPROXY` protocol](#goproxy-protocol) instead, which is
always permitted. By default, the `go` command uses the Go module mirror
([proxy.golang.org](https://proxy.golang.org)) for public modules and only
falls back to version control for private modules or when the mirror refuses to
serve a public package (typically for legal reasons). Therefore, clients can
still access public code served from Bazaar, Fossil, or Subversion repositories
by default, because those downloads use the Go module mirror, which takes on the
security risk of running the version control commands using a custom sandbox.

The `GOVCS` variable can be used to change the allowed version control systems
for specific modules. The `GOVCS` variable applies when building packages
in both module-aware mode and GOPATH mode. When using modules, the patterns match
against the module path. When using GOPATH, the patterns match against the
import path corresponding to the root of the version control repository.

The general form of the `GOVCS` variable is a comma-separated list of
`pattern:vcslist` rules. The pattern is a [glob pattern](/pkg/path#Match) that
must match one or more leading elements of the module or import path. The
vcslist is a pipe-separated list of allowed version control commands, or `all`
to allow use of any known command, or `off` to allow nothing. Note that if a
module matches a pattern with vcslist `off`, it may still be downloaded if the
origin server uses the `mod` scheme, which instructs the go command to download
the module using the [`GOPROXY` protocol](#goproxy-protocol). The earliest
matching pattern in the list applies, even if later patterns might also match.

For example, consider:

```
GOVCS=github.com:git,evil.com:off,*:git|hg
```

With this setting, code with a module or import path beginning with
`github.com/` can only use `git`; paths on `evil.com` cannot use any version
control command, and all other paths (`*` matches everything) can use
only `git` or `hg`.

The special patterns `public` and `private` match public and private
module or import paths. A path is private if it matches the `GOPRIVATE`
variable; otherwise it is public.

If no rules in the `GOVCS` variable match a particular module or import path,
the `go` command applies its default rule, which can now be summarized
in `GOVCS` notation as `public:git|hg,private:all`.

To allow unfettered use of any version control system for any package, use:

```
GOVCS=*:all
```

To disable all use of version control, use:

```
GOVCS=*:off
```

The [`go env -w`
command](/cmd/go/#hdr-Print_Go_environment_information) can be
used to set the `GOVCS` variable for future go command invocations.

`GOVCS` was introduced in Go 1.16. Earlier versions of Go may use any known
version control tool for any module.

## Module zip files {#zip-files}

Module versions are distributed as `.zip` files. There is rarely any need to
interact directly with these files, since the `go` command creates, downloads,
and extracts them automatically from [module proxies](#glos-module-proxy) and
version control repositories. However, it's still useful to know about these
files to understand cross-platform compatibility constraints or when
implementing a module proxy.

The [`go mod download`](#go-mod-download) command downloads zip files
for one or more modules, then extracts those files into the [module
cache](#glos-module-cache). Depending on `GOPROXY` and other [environment
variables](#environment-variables), the `go` command may either download
zip files from a proxy or clone source control repositories and create
zip files from them. The `-json` flag may be used to find the location of
download zip files and their extracted contents in the module cache.

The [`golang.org/x/mod/zip`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/zip?tab=doc)
package may be used to create, extract, or check contents of zip files
programmatically.

### File path and size constraints {#zip-path-size-constraints}

There are a number of restrictions on the content of module zip files. These
constraints ensure that zip files can be extracted safely and consistently on
a wide range of platforms.

* A module zip file may be at most 500 MiB in size. The total uncompressed size
  of its files is also limited to 500 MiB. `go.mod` files are limited to 16 MiB.
  `LICENSE` files are also limited to 16 MiB. These limits exist to mitigate
  denial of service attacks on users, proxies, and other parts of the module
  ecosystem. Repositories that contain more than 500 MiB of files in a module
  directory tree should tag module versions at commits that only include files
  needed to build the module's packages; videos, models, and other large assets
  are usually not needed for builds.
* Each file within a module zip file must begin with the prefix
  `$module@$version/` where `$module` is the module path and `$version` is the
  version, for example, `golang.org/x/mod@v0.3.0/`. The module path must be
  valid, the version must be valid and canonical, and the version must match the
  module path's major version suffix. See [Module paths and
  versions](#go-mod-file-ident) for specific definitions and restrictions.
* File modes, timestamps, and other metadata are ignored.
* Empty directories (entries with paths ending with a slash) may be included
  in module zip files but are not extracted. The `go` command does not include
  empty directories in zip files it creates.
* Symbolic links and other irregular files are ignored when creating zip files,
  since they aren't portable across operating systems and file systems, and
  there's no portable way to represent them in the zip file format.
* Files within directories named `vendor` are ignored when creating zip files,
  since `vendor` directories outside the main module are never used.
* Files within directories containing `go.mod` files, other than the module
  root directory, are ignored when creating zip files, since they are not part
  of the module. The `go` command ignores subdirectories containing `go.mod`
  files when extracting zip files.
* No two files within a zip file may have paths equal under Unicode case-folding
  (see [`strings.EqualFold`](https://pkg.go.dev/strings?tab=doc#EqualFold)).
  This ensures that zip files can be extracted on case-insensitive file systems
  without collisions.
* A `go.mod` file may or may not appear in the top-level directory
  (`$module@$version/go.mod`). If present, it must have the name `go.mod` (all
  lowercase). Files named `go.mod` are not allowed in any other directory.
* File and directory names within a module may consist of Unicode letters, ASCII
  digits, the ASCII space character (U+0020), and the ASCII punctuation
  characters `!#$%&()+,-.=@[]^_{}~`. Note that package paths may not contain all
  these characters. See
  [`module.CheckFilePath`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/module?tab=doc#CheckFilePath)
  and
  [`module.CheckImportPath`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/module?tab=doc#CheckImportPath)
  for the differences.
* A file or directory name up to the first dot must not be a reserved file name
  on Windows, regardless of case (`CON`, `com1`, `NuL`, and so on).

## Private modules {#private-modules}

Go modules are frequently developed and distributed on version control servers
and module proxies that aren't available on the public internet. The `go`
command can download and build modules from private sources, though it usually
requires some configuration.

The environment variables below may be used to configure access to private
modules. See [Environment variables](#environment-variables) for details. See
also [Privacy](#private-module-privacy) for information on controlling
information sent to public servers.

* `GOPROXY` — list of module proxy URLs. The `go` command will attempt to
  download modules from each server in sequence. The keyword `direct` instructs
  the `go` command to download modules from version control repositories
  where they're developed instead of using a proxy.
* `GOPRIVATE` — list of glob patterns of module path prefixes that should be
  considered private. Acts as a default value for `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB`.
* `GONOPROXY` — list of glob patterns of module path prefixes that should not be
  downloaded from a proxy. The `go` command will download matching modules from
  version control repositories where they're developed, regardless of `GOPROXY`.
* `GONOSUMDB` — list of glob patterns of module path prefixes that should not be
  checked using the public checksum database,
  [sum.golang.org](https://sum.golang.org).
* `GOINSECURE` — list of glob patterns of module path prefixes that may be
  retrieved over HTTP and other insecure protocols.

These variables may be set in the development environment (for example, in a
`.profile` file), or they may be set permanently with [`go env
-w`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Print_Go_environment_information).

The rest of this section describes common patterns for providing access to
private module proxies and version control repositories.

### Private proxy serving all modules {#private-module-proxy-all}

A central private proxy server that serves all modules (public and private)
provides the most control for administrators and requires the least
configuration for individual developers.

To configure the `go` command to use such a server, set the following
environment variables, replacing `https://proxy.corp.example.com` with your
proxy URL and `corp.example.com` with your module prefix:

```
GOPROXY=https://proxy.corp.example.com
GONOSUMDB=corp.example.com
```

The `GOPROXY` setting instructs the `go` command to only download modules from
`https://proxy.corp.example.com`; the `go` command will not connect to other
proxies or version control repositories.

The `GONOSUMDB` setting instructs the `go` command not to use the public
checksum database to authenticate modules with paths starting with
`corp.example.com`.

A proxy running in this configuration will likely need read access to
private version control servers. It will also need access to the public internet
to download new versions of public modules.

There are several existing implementations of `GOPROXY` servers that may be used
this way. A minimal implementation would serve files from a [module
cache](#glos-module-cache) directory and would use [`go mod
download`](#go-mod-download) (with suitable configuration) to retrieve missing
modules.

### Private proxy serving private modules {#private-module-proxy-private}

A private proxy server may serve private modules without also serving publicly
available modules. The `go` command can be configured to fall back to
public sources for modules that aren't available on the private server.

To configure the `go` command to work this way, set the following environment
variables, replacing `https://proxy.corp.example.com` with the proxy URL and
`corp.example.com` with the module prefix:

```
GOPROXY=https://proxy.corp.example.com,https://proxy.golang.org,direct
GONOSUMDB=corp.example.com
```

The `GOPROXY` setting instructs the `go` command to try to download modules from
`https://proxy.corp.example.com` first. If that server responds with 404 (Not
Found) or 410 (Gone), the `go` command will fall back to
`https://proxy.golang.org`, then to direct connections to repositories.

The `GONOSUMDB` setting instructs the `go` command not to use the public
checksum database to authenticate modules whose paths start with
`corp.example.com`.

Note that a proxy used in this configuration may still control access to public
modules, even though it doesn't serve them. If the proxy responds to a request
with an error status other than 404 or 410, the `go` command will not fall back
to later entries in the `GOPROXY` list. For example, the proxy could respond
with 403 (Forbidden) for a module with an unsuitable license or with known
security vulnerabilities.

### Direct access to private modules {#private-module-proxy-direct}

The `go` command may be configured to bypass public proxies and download private
modules directly from version control servers. This is useful when running a
private proxy server is not feasible.

To configure the `go` command to work this way, set `GOPRIVATE`, replacing
`corp.example.com` the private module prefix:

```
GOPRIVATE=corp.example.com
```

The `GOPROXY` variable does not need to be changed in this situation. It
defaults to `https://proxy.golang.org,direct`, which instructs the `go` command
to attempt to download modules from `https://proxy.golang.org` first, then fall
back to a direct connection if that proxy responds with 404 (Not Found) or 410
(Gone).

The `GOPRIVATE` setting instructs the `go` command not to connect to a proxy or
to the checksum database for modules starting with `corp.example.com`.

An internal HTTP server may still be needed to [resolve module paths to
repository URLs](#vcs-find). For example, when the `go` command downloads the
module `corp.example.com/mod`, it will send a GET request to
`https://corp.example.com/mod?go-get=1`, and it will look for the repository URL
in the response. To avoid this requirement, ensure that each private module path
has a VCS suffix (like `.git`) marking the repository root prefix. For example,
when the `go` command downloads the module `corp.example.com/repo.git/mod`, it
will clone the Git repository at `https://corp.example.com/repo.git` or
`ssh://corp.example.com/repo.git` without needing to make additional requests.

Developers will need read access to repositories containing private modules.
This may be configured in global VCS configuration files like `.gitconfig`.
It's best if VCS tools are configured not to need interactive authentication
prompts. By default, when invoking Git, the `go` command disables interactive
prompts by setting `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, but it respects explicit settings.

### Passing credentials to private proxies {#private-module-proxy-auth}

The `go` command supports HTTP [basic
authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) when
communicating with proxy servers.

Credentials may be specified in a [`.netrc`
file](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html).
For example, a `.netrc` file containing the lines below would configure the `go`
command to connect to the machine `proxy.corp.example.com` with the given
username and password.

```
machine proxy.corp.example.com
login jrgopher
password hunter2
```

The location of the file may be set with the `NETRC` environment variable. If
`NETRC` is not set, the `go` command will read `$HOME/.netrc` on UNIX-like
platforms or `%USERPROFILE%\_netrc` on Windows.

Fields in `.netrc` are separated with spaces, tabs, and newlines. Unfortunately,
these characters cannot be used in usernames or passwords. Note also that the
machine name cannot be a full URL, so it's not possible to specify different
usernames and passwords for different paths on the same machine.

Alternatively, credentials may be specified directly in `GOPROXY` URLs. For
example:

```
GOPROXY=https://jrgopher:hunter2@proxy.corp.example.com
```

Use caution when taking this approach: environment variables may be appear
in shell history and in logs.

### Passing credentials to private repositories {#private-module-repo-auth}

The `go` command may download a module directly from a version control
repository. This is necessary for private modules if a private proxy is
not used. See [Direct access to private modules](#private-module-proxy-direct)
for configuration.

The `go` command runs version control tools like `git` when downloading
modules directly. These tools perform their own authentication, so you may
need to configure credentials in a tool-specific configuration file like
`.gitconfig`.

To ensure this works smoothly, make sure the `go` command uses the correct
repository URL and that the version control tool doesn't require a password to
be entered interactively. The `go` command prefers `https://` URLs over other
schemes like `ssh://` unless the scheme was specified when [looking up the
repository URL](#vcs-find). For GitHub repositories specifically, the `go`
command assumes `https://`.

<!-- TODO(golang.org/issue/26134): if this issue is fixed, we can remove the
mention of the special case for GitHub above. -->

For most servers, you can configure your client to authenticate over HTTP. For
example, GitHub supports using [OAuth personal access tokens as HTTP
passwords](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/extending-github/git-automation-with-oauth-tokens).
You can store HTTP passwords in a `.netrc` file, as when [passing credentials to
private proxies](#private-module-proxy-auth).

Alternatively, you can rewrite `https://` URLs to another scheme. For example,
in `.gitconfig`:

```
[url "git@github.com:"]
    insteadOf = https://github.com/
```

For more information, see [Why does "go get" use HTTPS when cloning a
repository?](/doc/faq#git_https)

### Privacy {#private-module-privacy}

The `go` command may download modules and metadata from module proxy
servers and version control systems. The environment variable `GOPROXY`
controls which servers are used. The environment variables `GOPRIVATE` and
`GONOPROXY` control which modules are fetched from proxies.

The default value of `GOPROXY` is:

```
https://proxy.golang.org,direct
```

With this setting, when the `go` command downloads a module or module metadata,
it will first send a request to `proxy.golang.org`, a public module proxy
operated by Google ([privacy policy](https://proxy.golang.org/privacy)). See
[`GOPROXY` protocol](#goproxy-protocol) for details on what information is sent
in each request. The `go` command does not transmit personally identifiable
information, but it does transmit the full module path being requested. If the
proxy responds with a 404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone) status, the `go` command
will attempt to connect directly to the version control system providing the
module. See [Version control systems](#vcs) for details.

The `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOPROXY` environment variables may be set to lists of glob
patterns matching module prefixes that are private and should not be requested
from any proxy. For example:

```
GOPRIVATE=*.corp.example.com,*.research.example.com
```

`GOPRIVATE` simply acts as a default for `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB`, so it's
not necessary to set `GONOPROXY` unless `GONOSUMDB` should have a different
value. When a module path is matched by `GONOPROXY`, the `go` command ignores
`GOPROXY` for that module and fetches it directly from its version control
repository. This is useful when no proxy serves private modules. See [Direct
access to private modules](#private-module-proxy-direct).

If there is a [trusted proxy serving all modules](#private-module-proxy-all),
then `GONOPROXY` should not be set. For example, if `GOPROXY` is set to one
source, the `go` command will not download modules from other sources.
`GONOSUMDB` should still be set in this situation.

```
GOPROXY=https://proxy.corp.example.com
GONOSUMDB=*.corp.example.com,*.research.example.com
```

If there is a [trusted proxy serving only private
modules](#private-module-proxy-private), `GONOPROXY` should not be set, but care
must be taken to ensure the proxy responds with the correct status codes. For
example, consider the following configuration:

```
GOPROXY=https://proxy.corp.example.com,https://proxy.golang.org
GONOSUMDB=*.corp.example.com,*.research.example.com
```

Suppose that due to a typo, a developer attempts to download a module that
doesn't exist.

```
go mod download corp.example.com/secret-product/typo@latest
```

The `go` command first requests this module from `proxy.corp.example.com`. If
that proxy responds with 404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone), the `go` command will
fall back to `proxy.golang.org`, transmitting the `secret-product` path in the
request URL. If the private proxy responds with any other error code, the `go`
command prints the error and will not fall back to other sources.

In addition to proxies, the `go` command may connect to the checksum database to
verify cryptographic hashes of modules not listed in `go.sum`. The `GOSUMDB`
environment variable sets the name, URL, and public key of the checksum
database. The default value of `GOSUMDB` is `sum.golang.org`, the public
checksum database operated by Google ([privacy
policy](https://sum.golang.org/privacy)). See [Checksum
database](#checksum-database) for details on what is transmitted with each
request. As with proxies, the `go` command does not transmit personally
identifiable information, but it does transmit the full module path being
requested, and the checksum database cannot compute checksums for non-public
modules.

The `GONOSUMDB` environment variable may be set to patterns indicating which
modules are private and should not be requested from the checksum
database. `GOPRIVATE` acts as a default for `GONOSUMDB` and `GONOPROXY`, so it's
not necessary to set `GONOSUMDB` unless `GONOPROXY` should have a
different value.

A proxy may [mirror the checksum
database](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md#proxying-a-checksum-database).
If a proxy in `GOPROXY` does this, the `go` command will not connect to the
checksum database directly.

`GOSUMDB` may be set to `off` to disable use of the checksum database
entirely. With this setting, the `go` command will not authenticate downloaded
modules unless they're already in `go.sum`. See [Authenticating
modules](#authenticating).

## Module cache {#module-cache}

The <dfn>module cache</dfn> is the directory where the `go` command stores
downloaded module files. The module cache is distinct from the build cache,
which contains compiled packages and other build artifacts.

The default location of the module cache is `$GOPATH/pkg/mod`. To use a
different location, set the `GOMODCACHE` [environment
variable](#environment-variables).

The module cache has no maximum size, and the `go` command does not remove its
contents automatically.

The cache may be shared by multiple Go projects developed on the same machine.
The `go` command will use the same cache regardless of the location of the
main module. Multiple instances of the `go` command may safely access the
same module cache at the same time.

The `go` command creates module source files and directories in the cache with
read-only permissions to prevent accidental changes to modules after they're
downloaded. This has the unfortunate side-effect of making the cache difficult
to delete with commands like `rm -rf`. The cache may instead be deleted with
[`go clean -modcache`](#go-clean-modcache). Alternatively, when the
`-modcacherw` flag is used, the `go` command will create new directories with
read-write permissions. This increases the risk of editors, tests, and other
programs modifying files in the module cache. The [`go mod
verify`](#go-mod-verify) command may be used to detect modifications to
dependencies of the main module. It scans the extracted contents of each
module dependency and confirms they match the expected hash in `go.sum`.

The table below explains the purpose of most files in the module cache. Some
transient files (lock files, temporary directories) are omitted. For each path,
`$module` is a module path, and `$version` is a version. Paths ending with
slashes (`/`) are directories. Capital letters in module paths and versions are
escaped using exclamation points (`Azure` is escaped as `!azure`) to avoid
conflicts on case-insensitive file systems.

## Authenticating modules {#authenticating}

When the `go` command downloads a module [zip file](#zip-files) or [`go.mod`
file](#go-mod-file) into the [module cache](#module-cache), it computes a
cryptographic hash and compares it with a known value to verify the file hasn't
changed since it was first downloaded. The `go` command reports a security error
if a downloaded file does not have the correct hash.

For `go.mod` files, the `go` command computes the hash from the file
content. For module zip files, the `go` command computes the hash from the names
and contents of files within the archive in a deterministic order. The hash is
not affected by file order, compression, alignment, and other metadata. See
[`golang.org/x/mod/sumdb/dirhash`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/sumdb/dirhash?tab=doc)
for hash implementation details.

The `go` command compares each hash with the corresponding line in the main
module's [`go.sum` file](go-sum-files). If the hash is different from the hash
in `go.sum`, the `go` command reports a security error and deletes the
downloaded file without adding it into the module cache.

If the `go.sum` file is not present, or if it doesn't contain a hash for the
downloaded file, the `go` command may verify the hash using the [checksum
database](#checksum-database), a global source of hashes for publicly available
modules. Once the hash is verified, the `go` command adds it to `go.sum` and
adds the downloaded file in the module cache. If a module is private (matched by
the `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOSUMDB` environment variables) or if the checksum
database is disabled (by setting `GOSUMDB=off`), the `go` command accepts the
hash and adds the file to the module cache without verifying it.

The module cache is usually shared by all Go projects on a system, and each
module may have its own `go.sum` file with potentially different hashes. To
avoid the need to trust other modules, the `go` command verifies hashes using
the main module's `go.sum` whenever it accesses a file in the module cache. Zip
file hashes are expensive to compute, so the `go` command checks pre-computed
hashes stored alongside zip files instead of re-hashing the files. The [`go mod
verify`](#go-mod-verify) command may be used to check that zip files and
extracted directories have not been modified since they were added to the module
cache.

### go.sum files {#go-sum-files}

A module may have a text file named `go.sum` in its root directory, alongside
its `go.mod` file. The `go.sum` file contains cryptographic hashes of the
module's direct and indirect dependencies. When the `go` command downloads a
module `.mod` or `.zip` file into the [module cache](#module-cache), it computes
a hash and checks that the hash matches the corresponding hash in the main
module's `go.sum` file. `go.sum` may be empty or absent if the module has no
dependencies or if all dependencies are replaced with local directories using
[`replace` directives](#go-mod-file-replace).

Each line in `go.sum` has three fields separated by spaces: a module path,
a version (possibly ending with `/go.mod`), and a hash.

* The module path is the name of the module the hash belongs to.
* The version is the version of the module the hash belongs to. If the version
  ends with `/go.mod`, the hash is for the module's `go.mod` file only;
  otherwise, the hash is for the files within the module's `.zip` file.
* The hash column consists of an algorithm name (like `h1`) and a base64-encoded
  cryptographic hash, separated by a colon (`:`). Currently, SHA-256 (`h1`) is
  the only supported hash algorithm. If a vulnerability in SHA-256 is discovered
  in the future, support will be added for another algorithm (named `h2` and
  so on).

The `go.sum` file may contain hashes for multiple versions of a module. The `go`
command may need to load `go.mod` files from multiple versions of a dependency
in order to perform [minimal version selection](#minimal-version-selection).
`go.sum` may also contain hashes for module versions that aren't needed anymore
(for example, after an upgrade). [`go mod tidy`](#go-mod-tidy) will add missing
hashes and will remove unnecessary hashes from `go.sum`.

### Checksum database {#checksum-database}

The checksum database is a global source of `go.sum` lines. The `go` command can
use this in many situations to detect misbehavior by proxies or origin servers.

The checksum database allows for global consistency and reliability for all
publicly available module versions. It makes untrusted proxies possible since
they can't serve the wrong code without it going unnoticed. It also ensures
that the bits associated with a specific version do not change from one day to
the next, even if the module's author subsequently alters the tags in their
repository.

The checksum database is served by [sum.golang.org](https://sum.golang.org),
which is run by Google. It is a [Transparent
Log](https://research.swtch.com/tlog) (or “Merkle Tree”) of `go.sum` line
hashes, which is backed by [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian). The
main advantage of a Merkle tree is that independent auditors can verify that it
hasn't been tampered with, so it is more trustworthy than a simple database.

The `go` command interacts with the checksum database using the protocol
originally outlined in [Proposal: Secure the Public Go Module
Ecosystem](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md#checksum-database).

The table below specifies queries that the checksum database must respond to.
For each path, `$base` is the path portion of the checksum database URL,
`$module` is a module path, and `$version` is a version. For example, if the
checksum database URL is `https://sum.golang.org`, and the client is requesting
the record for the module `golang.org/x/text` at version `v0.3.2`, the client
would send a `GET` request for
`https://sum.golang.org/lookup/golang.org/x/text@v0.3.2`.

To avoid ambiguity when serving from case-insensitive file systems,
the `$module` and `$version` elements are
[case-encoded](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/module#EscapePath)
by replacing every uppercase letter with an exclamation mark followed by the
corresponding lower-case letter. This allows modules `example.com/M` and
`example.com/m` to both be stored on disk, since the former is encoded as
`example.com/!m`.

Parts of the path surrounded by square brackets, like `[.p/$W]` denote optional
values.

        be verified using the server's public key. The tree description

        <code>$L</code>, <code>$K</code>th from the left, with a tile height of
        <code>$H</code>. The optional <code>.p/$W</code> suffix indicates a
        partial log tile with only <code>$W</code> hashes. Clients must fall
        back to fetching the full tile if a partial tile is not found.

      <td>
        Returns the record data for the leaf hashes in
        <code>/tile/$H/0/$K[.p/$W]</code> (with a literal <code>data</code> path
        element).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If the `go` command consults the checksum database, then the first
step is to retrieve the record data through the `/lookup` endpoint. If the
module version is not yet recorded in the log, the checksum database will try
to fetch it from the origin server before replying. This `/lookup` data
provides the sum for this module version as well as its position in the log,
which informs the client of which tiles should be fetched to perform proofs.
The `go` command performs “inclusion” proofs (that a specific record exists in
the log) and “consistency” proofs (that the tree hasn’t been tampered with)
before adding new `go.sum` lines to the main module’s `go.sum` file. It's
important that the data from `/lookup` should never be used without first
authenticating it against the signed tree hash and authenticating the signed
tree hash against the client's timeline of signed tree hashes.

Signed tree hashes and new tiles served by the checksum database are stored
in the module cache, so the `go` command only needs to fetch tiles that are
missing.

The `go` command doesn't need to directly connect to the checksum database. It
can request module sums via a module proxy that [mirrors the checksum
database](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md#proxying-a-checksum-database)
and supports the protocol above. This can be particularly helpful for private,
corporate proxies which block requests outside the organization.

The `GOSUMDB` environment variable identifies the name of checksum database to
use and optionally its public key and URL, as in:

```
GOSUMDB="sum.golang.org"
GOSUMDB="sum.golang.org+<publickey>"
GOSUMDB="sum.golang.org+<publickey> https://sum.golang.org"
```

The `go` command knows the public key of `sum.golang.org`, and also that the
name `sum.golang.google.cn` (available inside mainland China) connects to the
`sum.golang.org` checksum database; use of any other database requires giving
the public key explicitly. The URL defaults to `https://` followed by the
database name.

`GOSUMDB` defaults to `sum.golang.org`, the Go checksum database run by Google.
See https://sum.golang.org/privacy for the service's privacy policy.

If `GOSUMDB` is set to `off`, or if `go get` is invoked with the `-insecure`
flag, the checksum database is not consulted, and all unrecognized modules are
accepted, at the cost of giving up the security guarantee of verified
repeatable downloads for all modules. A better way to bypass the checksum
database for specific modules is to use the `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOSUMDB`
environment variables. See [Private Modules](#private-modules) for details.

The `go env -w` command can be used to
[set these variables](/pkg/cmd/go/#hdr-Print_Go_environment_information)
for future `go` command invocations.

## Environment variables {#environment-variables}

Module behavior in the `go` command may be configured using the environment
variables listed below. This list only includes module-related environment
variables. See [`go help
environment`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Environment_variables) for a list
of all environment variables recognized by the `go` command.

          List of module proxy URLs, separated by commas (<code>,</code>) or

          information about a module, it contacts each proxy in the list in

## Glossary {#glossary}

<a id="glos-build-constraint"></a>
**build constraint:** A condition that determines whether a Go source file is
used when compiling a package. Build constraints may be expressed with file name
suffixes (for example, `foo_linux_amd64.go`) or with build constraint comments
(for example, `// +build linux,amd64`). See [Build
Constraints](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints).

<a id="glos-build-list"></a>
**build list:** The list of module versions that will be used for a build
command such as `go build`, `go list`, or `go test`. The build list is
determined from the [main module's](#glos-main-module) [`go.mod`
file](#glos-go-mod-file) and `go.mod` files in transitively required modules
using [minimal version selection](#glos-minimal-version-selection). The build
list contains versions for all modules in the [module
graph](#glos-module-graph), not just those relevant to a specific command.

<a id="glos-canonical-version"></a>
**canonical version:** A correctly formatted [version](#glos-version) without
a build metadata suffix other than `+incompatible`. For example, `v1.2.3`
is a canonical version, but `v1.2.3+meta` is not.

<a id="glos-current-module"></a>
**current module:** Synonym for [main module](#glos-main-module).

<a id="glos-deprecated-module"></a>
**deprecated module:** A module that is no longer supported by its authors
(though major versions are considered distinct modules for this purpose).
A deprecated module is marked with a [deprecation
comment](#go-mod-file-module-deprecation) in the latest version of its
[`go.mod` file](#glos-go-mod-file).

<a id="glos-direct-dependency"></a>
**direct dependency:** A package whose path appears in an [`import`
declaration](/ref/spec#import_declarations) in a `.go` source file for a package
or test in the [main module](#glos-main-module), or the module containing such a
package. (Compare [indirect dependency](#glos-indirect-dependency).)

<a id="glos-direct-mode"></a>
**direct mode:** A setting of [environment variables](#environment-variables)
that causes the `go` command to download a module directly from a [version
control system](#vcs), as opposed to a [module proxy](#glos-module-proxy).
`GOPROXY=direct` does this for all modules. `GOPRIVATE` and `GONOPROXY` do this
for modules matching a list of patterns.

<a id="glos-go-mod-file"></a>
**`go.mod` file:** The file that defines a module's path, requirements, and
other metadata. Appears in the [module's root
directory](#glos-module-root-directory). See the section on [`go.mod`
files](#go-mod-file).

<a id="glos-import-path"></a>
**import path:** A string used to import a package in a Go source file.
Synonymous with [package path](#glos-package-path).

<a id="glos-indirect-dependency"></a>
**indirect dependency:** A package transitively imported by a package or test in
the [main module](#glos-main-module), but whose path does not appear in any
[`import` declaration](/ref/spec#import_declarations) in the main module;
or a module that appears in the [module graph](#glos-module-graph) but does not
provide any package directly imported by the main module.
(Compare [direct dependency](#glos-direct-dependency).)

<a id="glos-lazy-module-loading"></a>
**lazy module loading:** A change in Go 1.17 that avoids loading the [module
graph](#glos-module-graph) for commands that do not need it in modules that
specify `go 1.17` or higher. See [Lazy module loading](#lazy-loading).

<a id="glos-main-module"></a>
**main module:** The module in which the `go` command is invoked. The main
module is defined by a [`go.mod` file](#glos-go-mod-file) in the current
directory or a parent directory. See [Modules, packages, and
versions](#modules-overview).

<a id="glos-major-version"></a>
**major version:** The first number in a semantic version (`1` in `v1.2.3`). In
a release with incompatible changes, the major version must be incremented, and
the minor and patch versions must be set to 0. Semantic versions with major
version 0 are considered unstable.

<a id="glos-major-version-subdirectory"></a>
**major version subdirectory:** A subdirectory within a version control
repository matching a module's [major version
suffix](#glos-major-version-suffix) where a module may be defined. For example,
the module `example.com/mod/v2` in the repository with [root
path](#glos-repository-root-path) `example.com/mod` may be defined in the
repository root directory or the major version subdirectory `v2`. See [Module
directories within a repository](#vcs-dir).

<a id="glos-major-version-suffix"></a>
**major version suffix:** A module path suffix that matches the major version
number. For example, `/v2` in `example.com/mod/v2`. Major version suffixes are
required at `v2.0.0` and later and are not allowed at earlier versions. See
the section on [Major version suffixes](#major-version-suffixes).

<a id="glos-minimal-version-selection"></a>
**minimal version selection (MVS):** The algorithm used to determine the
versions of all modules that will be used in a build. See the section on
[Minimal version selection](#minimal-version-selection) for details.

<a id="glos-minor-version"></a>
**minor version:** The second number in a semantic version (`2` in `v1.2.3`). In
a release with new, backwards compatible functionality, the minor version must
be incremented, and the patch version must be set to 0.

<a id="glos-module"></a>
**module:** A collection of packages that are released, versioned, and
distributed together.

<a id="glos-module-cache"></a>
**module cache:** A local directory storing downloaded modules, located in
`GOPATH/pkg/mod`. See [Module cache](#module-cache).

<a id="glos-module-graph"></a>
**module graph:** The directed graph of module requirements, rooted at the [main
module](#glos-main-module). Each vertex in the graph is a module; each edge is a
version from a `require` statement in a `go.mod` file (subject to `replace` and
`exclude` statements in the main module's `go.mod` file.

<a id="glos-module-graph-pruning"></a>
**module graph pruning:** A change in Go 1.17 that reduces the size of the
module graph by omitting transitive dependencies of modules that specify `go
1.17` or higher. See [Module graph pruning](#graph-pruning).

<a id="glos-module-path"></a>
**module path:** A path that identifies a module and acts as a prefix for
package import paths within the module. For example, `"golang.org/x/net"`.

<a id="glos-module-proxy"></a>
**module proxy:** A web server that implements the [`GOPROXY`
protocol](#goproxy-protocol). The `go` command downloads version information,
`go.mod` files, and module zip files from module proxies.

<a id="glos-module-root-directory"></a>
**module root directory:** The directory that contains the `go.mod` file that
defines a module.

<a id="glos-module-subdirectory"></a>
**module subdirectory:** The portion of a [module path](#glos-module-path) after
the [repository root path](#glos-repository-root-path) that indicates the
subdirectory where the module is defined. When non-empty, the module
subdirectory is also a prefix for [semantic version
tags](#glos-semantic-version-tag). The module subdirectory does not include the
[major version suffix](#glos-major-version-suffix), if there is one, even if the
module is in a [major version subdirectory](#glos-major-version-subdirectory).
See [Module paths](#module-path).

<a id="glos-package"></a>
**package:** A collection of source files in the same directory that are
compiled together. See the [Packages section](/ref/spec#Packages) in the Go
Language Specification.

<a id="glos-package-path"></a>
**package path:** The path that uniquely identifies a package. A package path is
a [module path](#glos-module-path) joined with a subdirectory within the module.
For example `"golang.org/x/net/html"` is the package path for the package in the
module `"golang.org/x/net"` in the `"html"` subdirectory. Synonym of
[import path](#glos-import-path).

<a id="glos-patch-version"></a>
**patch version:** The third number in a semantic version (`3` in `v1.2.3`). In
a release with no changes to the module's public interface, the patch version
must be incremented.

<a id="glos-pre-release-version"></a>
**pre-release version:** A version with a dash followed by a series of
dot-separated identifiers immediately following the patch version, for example,
`v1.2.3-beta4`. Pre-release versions are considered unstable and are not
assumed to be compatible with other versions. A pre-release version sorts before
the corresponding release version: `v1.2.3-pre` comes before `v1.2.3`. See also
[release version](#glos-release-version).

<a id="glos-pseudo-version"></a>
**pseudo-version:** A version that encodes a revision identifier (such as a Git
commit hash) and a timestamp from a version control system. For example,
`v0.0.0-20191109021931-daa7c04131f5`. Used for [compatibility with non-module
repositories](#non-module-compat) and in other situations when a tagged
version is not available.

<a id="glos-release-version"></a>
**release version:** A version without a pre-release suffix. For example,
`v1.2.3`, not `v1.2.3-pre`. See also [pre-release
version](#glos-pre-release-version).

<a id="glos-repository-root-path"></a>
**repository root path:** The portion of a [module path](#glos-module-path) that
corresponds to a version control repository's root directory. See [Module
paths](#module-path).

<a id="glos-retracted-version"></a>
**retracted version:** A version that should not be depended upon, either
because it was published prematurely or because a severe problem was discovered
after it was published. See [`retract` directive](#go-mod-file-retract).

<a id="glos-semantic-version-tag"></a>
**semantic version tag:** A tag in a version control repository that maps a
[version](#glos-version) to a specific revision. See [Mapping versions to
commits](#vcs-version).

<a id="glos-selected-version"></a>
**selected version:** The version of a given module chosen by [minimal version
selection](#minimal-version-selection). The selected version is the highest
version for the module's path found in the [module graph](#glos-module-graph).

<a id="glos-vendor-directory"></a>
**vendor directory:** A directory named `vendor` that contains packages from
other modules needed to build packages in the main module. Maintained with
[`go mod vendor`](#go-mod-vendor). See [Vendoring](#vendoring).

<a id="glos-version"></a>
**version:** An identifier for an immutable snapshot of a module, written as the
letter `v` followed by a semantic version. See the section on
[Versions](#versions).
