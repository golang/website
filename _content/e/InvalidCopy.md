InvalidCopy occurs when the arguments are not of slice type or do not
have compatible type.

See https://golang.org/ref/spec#Appending_and_copying_slices for more
information on the type requirements for the copy built-in.

Example:
 func f() {
 	var x []int
 	y := []int64{1,2,3}
 	copy(x, y)
 }
```
