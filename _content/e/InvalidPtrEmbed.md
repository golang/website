InvalidPtrEmbed occurs when an embedded field is of the pointer form *T,
and T itself is itself a pointer, an unsafe.Pointer, or an interface.

Per the spec:
 "An embedded field must be specified as a type name T or as a pointer to
 a non-interface type name *T, and T itself may not be a pointer type."

Example:
 type T *int

 type S struct {
 	*T
 }
```
