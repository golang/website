MultiValAssignOp occurs when an assignment operation (+=, *=, etc) does
not have single-valued left-hand or right-hand side.

Per the spec:
 "In assignment operations, both the left- and right-hand expression lists
 must contain exactly one single-valued expression"

Example:
 func f() int {
 	x, y := 1, 2
 	x, y += 1
 	return x + y
 }
```
