```
WrongTypeArgCount occurs when a type or function is instantiated with an
incorrect number of type arguments, including when a generic type or
function is used without instantiation.

Errors involving failed type inference are assigned other error codes.

Example:
 type T[p any] int

 var _ T[int, string]

Example:
 func f[T any]() {}

 var x = f
```
