## Overview {#overview .sectionHeading}

### Go delivers speed, security, and developer-friendly tools for Web Applications

Go is designed to enable developers to rapidly develop scalable and secure web applications. Go ships with an easy to use, secure and performant web server and includes it own web templating library. Go has excellent support for all of the latest technologies from [HTTP/2](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http), to databases like [MySQL](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql), [MongoDB](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver) and [ElasticSearch](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch/v7), to the latest encryption standards including [TLS 1.3](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls). Go web applications run natively on [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) and [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) (for easy scaling) or on any environment, cloud, or operating system thanks to Go‚Äôs extreme portability.

## Key Benefits {#key-benefits .sectionHeading}

### Deploy across platforms in record speed

For enterprises, Go is preferred for providing rapid cross-platform deployment. With its goroutines, native compilation, and the URI-based package namespacing, Go code compiles to a single, small binary‚Äîwith zero dependencies‚Äîmaking it very fast.

### Leverage Go‚Äôs out-of-the-box performance to scale with ease

Tigran Bayburtsyan, Co-Founder and CTO at Hexact Inc., summarizes five key reasons his company switched to Go:

-   **Compiles into a single binary** ‚Äî ‚ÄúUsing static linking, Go actually combining all dependency libraries and modules into one single binary file based on OS type and architecture.‚Äù

-   **Static type system** ‚Äî ‚ÄúType system is really important for large scale applications.‚Äù

-   **Performance** ‚Äî ‚ÄúGo performed better because of its concurrency model and CPU scalability. Whenever we need to process some internal request, we are doing it with separate Goroutines which are 10x cheaper in resources than Python Threads.‚Äù

-   **No need for a web framework** ‚Äî ‚ÄúIn most of the cases you really don‚Äôt need any third-party library.‚Äù

-   **Great IDE support and debugging** ‚Äî ‚ÄúAfter rewriting all projects to Go, we got 64 percent less code than we had earlier.‚Äù
