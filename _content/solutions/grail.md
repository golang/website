linkTitle: Bigslice - A cluster computing system in Go
description: At GRAIL, we use the Go programming language for most of our bioinformatics,
  data processing, and machine learning tasks. Goâ€™s simplicity makes it easy for
  newcomers to learn; its transparent runtime semantics makes it easy to reason
  about performance; and its ability to control data layout and allocation makes
  it possible to write highly performant data processing code.
