linkTitle: Massive practice in Go at ByteDance
description:
  Go was introduced to ByteDance in 2014, and since then engineering teams across ByteDance have adopted Go to build products and services on a massive scale. 
  As we went deeper, relatively mature microservice best practices under Go were developed and summarized, which then were open-sourced and named CloudWeGo since 2021. 
  Now 70% of microservices within ByteDance are written by Go.
