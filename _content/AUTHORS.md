The Go project formerly maintained AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS files
listing the authors of commits in the Go project repositories.
The source control history is now the authoritative source for
this information.

Go's Gerrit instance can search for changes by specific authors.
For example \[[is:merged author:"Russ Cox"](https://go-review.googlesource.com/q/is:merged+author:%2522Russ+Cox%2522)\].
