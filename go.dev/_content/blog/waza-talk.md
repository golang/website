summary: Watch Rob Pike's talk, _Concurrency is not parallelism._
---


If there's one thing most people know about Go,
is that it is designed for concurrency.
No introduction to Go is complete without a demonstration of its goroutines and channels.

But when people hear the word _concurrency_ they often think of _parallelism_,
a related but quite distinct concept.
In programming, concurrency is the _composition_ of independently executing processes,
while parallelism is the simultaneous _execution_ of (possibly related) computations.
Concurrency is about _dealing with_ lots of things at once.
Parallelism is about _doing_ lots of things at once.

To clear up this conflation, Rob Pike gave a talk at [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)'s
Waza conference entitled
[_Concurrency is not parallelism_](https://blog.heroku.com/concurrency_is_not_parallelism),
and a video recording of the talk was released a few months ago.
